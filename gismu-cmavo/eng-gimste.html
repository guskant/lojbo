Body language, posturing, and stature are usually considered to be nonlocalized (body-general), although they need not be (and technically are not in general). Must be externally visible and/or internally sensed. Any non-body-part utensil/item (including clothing) must function as an extension of the body in the gesture. Need not be conscious or performed by a person (note that agent/performer is not mentioned in this definition); can, but need not, be accompanied by vocalizations (not necessarily linguistic), but the gesture itself is not primarily noise-producing. Might include sign language words or cheremes, although a more explicit word for linguistically organized and “full” cheremes is preferred (and especially for the sign language as a whole). x1 is possibly best typed by {nu} and/or {si'o}. x4 might be best expressed as an event; for example, it could be &quot;the event of the right hand touching the chest near the heart, with fist clenched&quot; for a salute, whereas/wherein x3 would be merely the fist/hand (and the chest near the heart). Use {cocygau} for: x1 (agent) gestures; x1 agentively/actively makes gesture x2, communicating x3, performed with body part(s) x4 in motion x5. Proposed short rafsi: -coc-.

The polytope in question need not actually be 'drawn'; an oriented frame of reference naturally 'projects' a polytopic sense onto all objects. x1 can be any linear manifold of lower dimension than the space in which it is embedded (defined by x3). The skewness is not relative to another linear manifold in some higher-dimensional space (the usual definition of &quot;skew&quot; in geometry) - it is simply a skewness (in a layperson sense) relative to points in a figure or axis in a coordinate system. Proposed by Gleki.

rakle [experimental]<br />x_1 is an atomic element in group x_2 [usually, vertical column; denotes electron configuration and, thereby, chemical similarity with vertical neighbors] and period x_3 [usually, horizontal row; denotes similarity in size with horizontal neighbors, as well as having the same number and type of electron shells as them] and belonging to other 'class'/'category'/'type'/having other properties x_4  according to scheme/organization pattern/standard/periodic table x_5.<br />x4 can be any category of similar elements, such as (but not limited to): metals, conductors, gases (at STP), or those elements which obey some sort of pattern following certain atomic/physical/chemical characteristics (such as first iönization energy, stability of nucleus, abnormalities in electron configuration according to naïve expectations, etc.). Groups may (presently) be hard to name (or unsystematic in such) since the periodic table may be infinitely large such that it is equipped with an infinite number of groups between any two mutually nonidentical groups. For now, use cmevla or brivla for designating groups; optionally, pick a representative member of that group. Periods can be designated similarly or by number (counting by ones from one (being the period containing hydrogen)).

Positive values of x4 are integrals, negative values are derivatives, and zero is identity; at the least, any real value may be supplied for x4; x4 has no default value.
