bai'i [experimental]<br />VUhU<br />mekso string operator (ternary): find-and-replace; in string/text/word/sequence X1 formally replace X2 (ordered tuple of terms to be replaced) with X3 (ordered tuple of terms to be respectively substituted)<br />X2 and X3 are ordered tuples of substrings/letters/characters/letterals/digits/numerals. The ith term in tuple X2 is replaced with the ith term in tuple X3; the replacements are executed simultaneously (thus, no overlap/contradiction can be allowed to arise in the substitution- in particular, in X2)  - alternatively, if there is overlap/conflict in/between the terms of X2, the replacements are performed in order of presentation (the ith term in X2 is replaced by the ith term in X3, and then the (i+1)th term in X2 is replaced with the (i+1)th term in X3, starting with the 1st term in each). X2 and X3 must have the same length/number of terms - alternatively, X3 cannot be longer/have more terms than X2; in this situation, the ith term of X2 is replaced with the ith term of X3 until and including when the last term of X3 is reached, after which point the remaining terms in X2 are not replaced at all. Use a permutation acting on X2 as the argument for X3 in order to rearrange the substrings of X1; if the alphabet is ordered, then operators can be applied to the letters in order to rotate through the alphabet. In particular, if X1 is a binary string (a word over an alphabet of two letters) and X2 is the 2-tuple of the letters of that binary alphabet (length-1 substrings), then without specification of X3, this operator defaults to bitwise binary negation (bit conjugation) wherein each letter in X1 is replaced by the unique other letter in the binary alphabet (otherwise, the replacement would be the identity/trivial replacement or just a formal substitution letter-by-letter which does not really change the nature of the word). X1 and each entry in X2 and X3 should be quoted, match a necessary type (such as being a character), or be abstracted a level by symbolics. In general, the replacement is formal and the strings in X3 need not be over the same alphabet as the one over which X1 is written. This operator is useful for combinatorial lines and for expanding digits (such as, in a binary string, replacing each occurrence of &quot;0&quot; with &quot;01&quot; and each occurrence of &quot;1&quot; with &quot;10&quot;; note that the replacement is instantaneous and simultaneous for all terms of X2 and every occurrence of such terms in X1, thus this substitution is perfectly acceptable).

Let p_i be a prime for all i, with p_1 = 2 and the ith prime (in the normal monotonic increasing order) being p_i. Let all other symbols match the aforementioned conditions. Represent the nth term of the sequence x3 by x3_n; represent the function in x2 being applied to the number m by x2(m).  Then x1 be'ei'oi x2 boi x3 boi x4 produces the set of all numbers of the form x3_(x1) * (p_1)^(e_1)  *...* (p_(x1))^(e_(x1)), where e_j belongs to the intersection of the interval [0, x2(x1)] with x4.

bu'ai [experimental]<br />NU<br />abstractor: abstractor to create logically quantified selbri variable to be used in predicate logic of third or higher order.<br />{zo'e} and {da} are a constant and a bound variable of predicate logic of first order respectively; {co'e} and {bu'a} are a selbri constant and a bound selbri variable of predicate logic of second order respectively; in order to express predicate logic of third or higher order, it is essential to have selbri that treat selbri variables in the domain of all selbri of second order. {su'u} and {bu'ai} in selma'o NU can compose respectively a selbri constant and a bound selbri variable in the domain of all selbri of second order. In the case that {bu'ai} takes plural number of selbri variables, connect them with {ju'e} or something. Higher order is also possible by nesting {bu'ai}. Example: su'o bu'ai xe'u kei su'o bu'a ro da zo'u bu'ai da bu'a (This {xe'u} is an abstraction-variable-indicator-{selbrisle} used in order to put a word of selma'o NU in prenex.)

</p><p>
ce'oi [experimental]<br />JOI<br />argument list separator: acts as a comma between arguments in an argument list supplied to a function.<br />&quot;ce'oi&quot; is the word of choice to separate the arguments in bridi_3. Using {ce'o} there has obvious limitations when the selbri actually calls for a sequence. Obviously, ce'oi has issues too if the selbri can accept an argument list, but this can be circumvented more readily with {ke}...{ke'e} brackets than it can with {ce'o}. Consider &quot;.i lo ka broda cu selbri fi ko'a ce'o ko'e&quot;. Without inspecting the type requirements of {broda} and the respective types of {ko'a} and {ko'e}, one cannot determine the meaning of the {bridi}. Furthermore, if one accepts non-static typing of {sumti} places, multiple correct answers can be given for a question asking what is the bridi_1. This would create ambiguity that is otherwise resolved by &quot;ce'oi&quot;. See also {ka}, {du'u}, {me'au}

de'ai [experimental]<br />DEhAI<br />default value (re)specification/(re)assignment/(re)definition/over-write; set new default value (terbri-specific; permanent)<br />Terminates immediately previous sumti.  The immediately following (next) unfilled terbri at that level of nesting is affected by this word; if no such terbri exists at that level of nesting, this word's affects apply to the next unfilled terbri in the immediately higher level of nesting (unnested once); if no unfilled terbri exist at any/all levels of nesting and following the immediately previous sumti (even if unfilled terbri exist prior to that sumti), this word has no meaningful affect and can be ignored.  This word must be followed by a sumti; for the purpose of this explanation, this sumti will be xy (as in &quot;de'ai xy&quot;).  The affected terbri is defined to default to the value xy (the sumti as a whole, including gadri, tanru, relative clauses, etc.); in other words, when not explicitly filled or when filled be {di'au}, the sumti value filling the affected terbri is that of xy.  This affect remains in effect until the end of the text/conversation or until/unless the default setting of this terbri explicitly redefined (overriding by {di'ei} is temporary/only applies to that usage). If xy is {zo'e}, the default value is completely general and elliptical; thus, permanently overriding a default setting on a specific terbri may be done by &quot;de'ai zo'e&quot;. The scope of this word fully encompasses and ends with the following sumti (xy); thus, the second sumti, same-/higher-level terminator, a FA cmavo, etc. following this word ends the new default specification in addition to its other functions.  Additionally, this word does not actually fill the affected terbri with any particular sumti/value; it merely defines its default value hereinafter. CAUTION: Thus, the second same-level sumti uttered actually fills the affected terbri; in order to access the newly-defined default value of the terbri immediately after definition, follow &quot;xy&quot; (with terminator) immediately with implicit (or possibly explicit) &quot;{zo'e}&quot; (possibly necessitating terminators), &quot;{di'au}&quot;, or &quot;xy&quot; itself. Moreover, therefore, the default value defined by this word does not immediately/necessarily affect the truth value of the statement in which it appears (it only does so if the second following sumti is not {di'au}, implicit (or possibly) explicit {zo'e}, or xy itself); however, in all future uses of the brivla to which the terbri belongs, unless explicitly filled with a sumti of a different value, the truth value of those statements will be affected.  Also, {su} does not erase this new definition of default. If the affected terbri is naturally defined to have a default or if it has no naturally defined default value, this word semi-permanently over-writes them.

di'au [experimental]<br />KOhA7<br />pro-sumti and sumyzmico: discourse-interior default it (terbri-specific)<br />Explicitly and emphatically references the specified default value of the relevant terbri as specified/designated by the discourse; thus, its value is context-dependent and subject to specification modifications. It does not necessarily reference the value defined &quot;officially&quot;. ({zo'e}, implicit or explicit, may do so as well, but the use of this word implies some degree of a more deliberate choice to follow the default specification.) When a default of the terbri is not specified by the previous discourse (nor by the discourse-exterior &quot;official&quot; definition of the terbri if not specification modifications have been made previously), this word is equivalent to completely general and elliptical {zo'e}.

di'ei [experimental]<br />KOhA7<br />pro-sumti and sumyzmico: an elliptical/unspecified value which does not necessarily obey the default setting for the corresponding terbri that is explicitly specified in the definition of the word; has some value which makes bridi true<br />Some brivla have default specifications for certain terbri; when any explicit sumti is omitted from filling these terbri (an implicit {zo'e} fills them instead), the meaning of that sumti is interpreted in accordance with the default specification; it is reasonable to suppose that an explicit {zo'e} used in order to fill such terbri will likewise obey the default specification in its interpretation.  Thus, there is no simple way to reference the &quot;general&quot; elliptical/unspecified value for these sumti, other than by using this word.  {zo'e} typically is interpreted as meaning any value of some general and unspecified set of potential sumti referents, modulated by context and the need to make the statement true; in the case of an explicit default setting of a terbri by the definition of a word, {di'ei} takes on this general and unspecified meaning, effectively ignoring the default (although it can take on the value of that default (doing so, simply, is just not necessary)); when no default is specified for the terbri in the definition, this word has the same meaning as {zo'e}.

fau'au [experimental]<br />JAhOI<br />two-tier function map/assignment writer notation: X1 (ordered list, no repetitious terms) maps termwise-respectively to X2 (ordered list; may be repetitious but must have exactly as many terms as X1)<br />So named because, in mathematical notation, the domain set of the function is written down in some order in its entirety and then, below it, the range of the function is written so that each image and preimage line up vertically with their appropriate/respective partner. Really useful when mapping from a countable set/object that is either human-small or in which the pattern is clear. Occasionally used for a more explicit form of notation for permutations (in which cycle decomposition is not necessarily as evident, but the structure as a how is, at least, explicit). The ith term of X1 is mapped to the ith term of X2; there is no knowledge of what happens to any value that is not term of list X1.  Useful for lambda calculus.

ja'oi [experimental]<br />JAhOI<br />permutation cycle writer notation start<br />Basically like {jo'i}, but for cycles. Use {boi} in order to separate terms.  Terminated by {tei'u}. In this notation, each term maps to the the subsequent term as read from left to right or heard in chronological order of utterance; the last term (immediately before {tei'u}) maps to the first term. The objected constructed is a cyclic permutation, a group element. The singleton cycle is identity on that term. It can be applied to a single element among its terms or may left group act upon a set or structure, or an element if the application is not directly upon it (such as when the application is to an index or variable of that element). Permutations are composed when viewed from outside of their group structure and have the group operator act upon them when within that context. The transposition (1  2) is expressed as ' li ja'oi pa boi re tei'u '. See also: {tei'u}, {ma'o'e}, {gu'ai}, {ru'ei}, {fa'ai}.

Not literally the number of symbols used, but the number of meaningful &quot;spots&quot; occupied; for example &quot;(1,0)&quot; uses five characters, but its length is just 2 (for &quot;1&quot; and then &quot;0&quot;); this is due to the fact that formal representation may vary but the amount of information conveyed must remain constant. Note that digit strings are essentially considered to be vectors in the basis of powers of the base.

Potentially useful for academic or technical honesty. &quot;Error&quot; may be rendered as &quot;incompleteness of truth&quot; or &quot;approximation&quot; in this context.

jo'au [experimental]<br />MAI<br />change version/dialect of parser<br />The morphology and the grammar of numbers preceding to {jo'au}, including ``word''-{bu}, should conform to the version 134 of the page ``BPFK Section: PEG Morphology Algorithm'' on the website lojban.org and the official grammar for number cmavo, so that a {jo'au} cluster forms a free modifier compatible with every version/dialect of lojban parser: for example, ``jie bu jo'au'' and ``xei jo'au'' are not meaningful clusters. As a standard usage, {jo'au} cluster appears at the very beginning of the whole text, just as the inverse of the usage of {fa'o}. The scope of the meaning of {jo'au} cluster spans over the following part until the next {jo'au} cluster appears. Optionally, if the first {jo'au} cluster appears in the middle of a text, the meaning of it spans from the beginning of the text until the next {jo'au} cluster appears. Examples of meaning: cylylypapi'epa jo'au (official yacc and jbofi'e http://www.lojban.org/jboski/ ) ; camxes.bu jo'au (current peg http://camxes.lojban.org/ ) ; iocixes.bu jo'au (zasni gerna of la xorxes https://skami2.iocikun.jp/lojban/zasniGerna , http://www.lojban.org/tiki/zasni+gerna ) ; ilmentufa burenopavopi'epapapi'erevo jo'au (ilmentufa version 2014-11-24 http://mw.lojban.org/extensions/ilmentufa/camxes-exp.html , https://github.com/Ilmen-vodhr/ilmentufa ) ; fancylojban.bu jo'au (fancylojban http://mw.lojban.org/lmw/fancylojban , http://mw.lojban.org/lmw/ce_ki_tau_jau - no parser yet.)

ju'au [experimental]<br />JUhAU<br />semi-mathematical binary operator: named number base operator/interpreter<br />Follows a number and is followed by a sumti (introduced with appropriate gadri); scope terminates with the end of the sumti. The construct as a whole syntactically functions as a parenthetical so that mekso may be resumed immediately thereafter without any difficulty. The preceding number is semantically interpreted according to the description to which the following sumti refers. If a sequence is supplied as the following sumti, the preceding number is interpreted so that each digit, starting from the left, is understood as a multiple of the corresponding value in the sequence under the ordering given (which may produce an invalid/ill-formed result).

Application to a graph is ambiguous: is it the number of vertices or edges, or both, or neither, (if it defined at all)? For a set, each unique heretofore not counted element increments the running subtotal by 1 if the set is countable (small infinite or finite). See: {cu'a}, {zilkancu}, {nilzilcmi}, {gu'au'i}.

</p><p>
ka'o'ai [experimental]<br />PA5<br />imaginary i (non-comma)<br />This is literally a unit, a pure number that is treated as a scalar; it is what happens when considering C to be a field over C - ordered pairs/tuples for coordinates no longer make much sense. Thus, this number operates exactly as one might think i would/should operate: as a single number, without components. In certain bases, it can be used a pure digit (which simplifies some potential numeric strings, compared to the usage of {ka'o} therein). See also: {ka'o}
</p><p>
ka'o'ei [experimental]<br />imaginary i, comma - spherical coordinates: first coordinate gives magnitude (complex modulus/radius) of the number, the second number gives the angle from the positive real axis measured counterclockwise (default: in the primary branch/Arg) as measured in some units (which that number should contain; the contextless default will suppose radians); the angle is not normalized<br />The number (r, x) = r*e^(i x). The angle x is (by default) measured in radians and is not normalized (contains no hidden/inherent multiples of pi). See also: {te'o}, {ka'o}.

kei'ai [experimental]<br />PEhO<br />mekso style converter: elementwise application of operator<br />Prefixed to an operator/function that operates on numbers, thereby transforming it to a set operator (thus its arguments must be sets where before they were numbers), as defined in a given structure. Produces the set of all numbers that are given by some ordered pair of elements (the nth term of which belongs to the nth set specified) with the operator acting on them (per the rules of that operator). The set produced may include empty terms and/or infinity. Let &quot;✦&quot; represent the operator; then X_1 kei'ai ✦ X_2 boi X_3 boi X_4 = Set(x_1✦x_2✦x_3✦x_4: x_i in X_i). See also {kei'au} for a similar but different word.
</p><p>
kei'au [experimental]<br />KEIhAU<br />mekso operator: finite result set derived from/on set A with/due to operator/function B under ordering C<br />Equivalent to: lo'i li zy du ca'e li pe'o se'au mau'au B zai'ai vei ma'o xy boi ny ve'o boi tau sy boi C ku poi ke'a cmaci xanri zi'e poi ke'a mleca li ci'i zo'u tau sy klesi A. Acts on an operator/function (b) and produces all finite results of that operator being used on any allowable number of elements of the set a without repetition within any given application. The result must be defined (and finite, obviously). Application of the operator on nothing (the elements of the empty set) is generically allowed and follows convention (for example, an empty sum may evaluate to 0). Differs from {kei'ai}. Use {mau'au} and {zai'ai} for quoting B. C will be specified explicitly (possibly elsewhere) and/or via {zoi'ai}.
</p><p>
kei'i [experimental]<br />KEIhI<br />non-logical connective/mekso operator - variable arity: X1 \\ X2<br />Ordered: 'x1 kei'i x2' is not generally the same as/equivalent to 'x2 kei'i x1'. If X1 is not explicitly specified, it is taken to be some universal set in the discourse (of which all other mentioned sets are subsets, at the least); in this case, the word operates more as the set (absolute) complement. When X1 is specified, it represents the set relative complement. Somewhat analogous to logical NOT (just as intersection is analogous to logical AND, union is analogous to logical AND-OR). The preferred description/name in English is &quot;set (theoretic) exclusion&quot;.

le'ai [experimental]<br />LEhAI<br />replace recent mistakenly uttered text<br />The {lo'ai} ... {sa'ai} ... {le'ai} replacement construct asks the listener to replace the text after {lo'ai} with the text after {sa'ai}.  The order {sa'ai} ... {lo'ai} ... {le'ai} is also allowed, and either or both parts can be omitted and thus left up to context.  When both parts are omitted, the word {le'ai} on its own indicates that a mistake was made while leaving all the details up to context. It is also possible to attach SAI to a le'ai construct: le'ai {dai} (or le'ai {da'oi} ko'a) indicates that someone else made a mistake; le'ai {pei} asks whether someone else made a mistake; and {sai}, {ru'e} and {cu'i} can be used to indicate the importance of the substitution. Furthermore, le'ai {nai} can be used to explicitly deny mistakes instead of acknowledging them (compare &quot;sic&quot;).

se'u'o [experimental]<br />SE<br />selbri conversion question<br />Asks for the SE word that is intended (or at least makes the sentence true). Subscript a set of numbers that represent the order of terbri in question; the subscripted set can be a set of ordered or unordered tuples, specifying exactly which terbri may be exchanged. 'la .ralf. se'u'o xi li re ce li ci pi'u li re cebo li ci klama by boi cy' = 'Did Ralph come to B from C or to C from B?' (notably, 'Did B come to Ralph from C?' is not a possible option for answering the question). An answer is a SE string that is allowed by the selbri and by the subscripts; continuing the example, if the response is 'Ralph went to C from B', one would respond with '.i {setese}'.  Any SE word works for the general question possibility (which is the unrestricted/non-subscripted case). Essentially 'se'u'o xi sy' is equivalent to 'se xi li xo poi ke'a cmima sy' (where '{te}' is basically understood as ' se xi li jo'i pa boi ci te'u ', etc.), but the answer can be a complicated ordered sequence/string of SE words; this word complements specifically {fi'a} in the typical/same way that SE complements FA. Typically, leaving the subscripted set vague or not completely free of every possible semantic or syntactic pathology is perfectly fine; syntax and practicality will typically restrict it enough for reasonable responses to be made. See also: {re'au'e} (which alone would be used in answering that 'Ralph goes to B from C' in the previous question).

This word begins a parenthetical which can contain UI cmavo and applies these cmavo as a string of UI to the immediately previous UI cmavo metalinguistically (as if the external UI are any other type of word which can be acted upon by UI). An omitted UI (external or internal) in this case is equivalent to {ge'e}.

xau'e'o [experimental]<br />XAUhEhO<br />mekso convention default specification/definition (explicit)<br />This word is followed by a list of rules. The rules specify the convention by which mekso or mathematical expressions (of various kinds) are to be interpreted. Such conventions are taken to remain in effect until the end of the discourse, until repealed, or if the come to conflict with subsequent rules so marked; in the lattermost case, the subsequent rule takes precedent and the earlier rules that are in conflict with it are ignored only in the most minimal domain of application possible (for example, a rule saying &quot;left composition of functions is denoted by &quot;°&quot; in all cases&quot; could be followed by a rule saying &quot;when a linear transformation can be represented by a matrix, left composition of two such functions is equivalent to left multiplication of their corresponding matrices and so their left composition may be represented simply by juxtaposition as is typical with/for multiplication&quot; with result being that &quot;°&quot; is to be used for all left compositions of functions except when both functions being composed are linear transformations admitting matrix representations, in which case &quot;°&quot; could be used but adjacency alone is sufficient to denote their left composition). Collections of rules (ordered in increasing precedence) can be named and referenced by such name expressed instead of those rules at length (such as calling a (specific) rather simple set of rules defining the order of operations &quot;.pemas.&quot;). See also: {xau'o'o}.
</p><p>
xau'o'o [experimental]<br />XAUhOhO<br />mekso convention cancellation<br />This word is followed by an evaluated {li} clause (yielding specifically a number n, which probably is a non-negative integer, or a set thereof (the elements of which will also be denoted by simply n, for simplicity) ). It repeals the nth most recent/last convention (counting backward) for mekso/mathematical expressions defined by {xau'e'o}. In order to repeal all such conventions (returning to the conventions specified by some grammar collection), the set should include all integers less than or equal to some sufficiently large integer (which might be {ro}); {ro} denotes the first rule defined (the last rule counting backward from the most recent)- it does not reference &quot;all rules defined&quot;; the most recent rule is denoted by {pa}. Any named body/ordered collection of rules (such as &quot;.pemas.&quot;) is treated as being only one rule for the purposes of such counting.

ze'ei [experimental]<br />ZEhEI<br />nonce word with existing grammar<br />Binds two arbitrary words together to form a nonce word whose semantics are indicated by the left word and whose grammar is the same as that of the right word. Useful for creating function words without having to allocate experimental cmavo forms.
</p><p>

</p><p>
zi'a [experimental]<br />UI3a<br />nonce-word indicator; indicates previous word is nonce-creation and may be nonstandard<br />Equivalent to {za'e} but in selma'o UI. See also {za'e}
</p><p>
zi'a'o [experimental]<br />VUhU<br />mathematical operator: the empty/null [one sense]/trivial [one sense]/blank operator<br />Arity is context-dependent. Induced structure is /probably/ empty/trivial [one sense] as well.

zi'e<br />ZIhE<br />joins relative clauses which apply to the same sumti.
</p><p>
zi'o<br />-zil-<br />KOhA7<br />pro-sumti: fills a sumti place, deleting it from selbri place structure;changes selbri semantics.
</p><p>
zi'oi [experimental]<br />ZIhOI<br />fills and deletes (in the manner as {zi'o}) all terbri of immediately previous word that are not explicitly filled with a sumti<br />Implicit/omitted {zo'e} will be deleted.  Deletion is only meaningful if the immediately previous word is a brivla with at least one unfilled (explicitly) terbri. In a tanru or other complicated construct, only the most recent word undergoes this terbri deletion (not every term in the construct). A selbri converted to a sumti by gadri has x1 terbri filled for the purposes of this word; likewise is the case for terbri accessed by {be} or {bei}; seltau in the main level of a sumti are filled by the gadri as well for the purposes of this word.

</p><p>
zo'e<br />KOhA7<br />pro-sumti: an elliptical/unspecified value; has some value which makes bridi true.
</p><p>
zo'ei [experimental]<br />LAhE<br />Something associated with; equivalent to ''zo'e pe'' or &quot;lo co'e be&quot;.<br />There are a lot of cases where people use &quot;tu'a&quot; where they actually mean zo'ei; once I noticed the usefulness of such a word to elide whole chunks of sentences, I started wanting it all the time.  -camgusmis

</p><p>
zoi'ai [experimental]<br />ZOIhAI<br />non-mekso quote/name substitution for ordered collection of prescriptions, descriptions, definitions, etc.<br />Delimited non-math/non-mekso quote (works like {zoi} in this respect). Treats the quote as a substitute for some formal collection of rules or mathematical description/definitions/notations; the exact meaning of the quote must be inferred as is the case with {la} or any quote; the quote is treated as a single block of text representative a single entity so described in only that case/context by the utterer; can be used to clarify the interpretation of text (convention specification; text need not be mathematical (in which case, it must be used in a meta-linguistic scope)) or as an operand of certain mathematical operators (or, more generally perhaps, bridi).  Might be useful for quoting names as descriptors for arguments of operands. For example: orderings, metrics, bases, densities, analytic properties, conventions, etc. can all be more easily described by a moniker than by a formal mathematical description.
