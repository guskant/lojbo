bai'i	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mekso string operator (ternary): find-and-replace; in string/text/word/sequence X1 formally replace X2 (ordered tuple of terms to be replaced) with X3 (ordered tuple of terms to be respectively substituted)	X2 and X3 are ordered tuples of substrings/letters/characters/letterals/digits/numerals. The ith term in tuple X2 is replaced with the ith term in tuple X3; the replacements are executed simultaneously (thus, no overlap/contradiction can be allowed to arise in the substitution- in particular, in X2)  - alternatively, if there is overlap/conflict in/between the terms of X2, the replacements are performed in order of presentation (the ith term in X2 is replaced by the ith term in X3, and then the (i+1)th term in X2 is replaced with the (i+1)th term in X3, starting with the 1st term in each). X2 and X3 must have the same length/number of terms - alternatively, X3 cannot be longer/have more terms than X2; in this situation, the ith term of X2 is replaced with the ith term of X3 until and including when the last term of X3 is reached, after which point the remaining terms in X2 are not replaced at all. Use a permutation acting on X2 as the argument for X3 in order to rearrange the substrings of X1; if the alphabet is ordered, then operators can be applied to the letters in order to rotate through the alphabet. In particular, if X1 is a binary string (a word over an alphabet of two letters) and X2 is the 2-tuple of the letters of that binary alphabet (length-1 substrings), then without specification of X3, this operator defaults to bitwise binary negation (bit conjugation) wherein each letter in X1 is replaced by the unique other letter in the binary alphabet (otherwise, the replacement would be the identity/trivial replacement or just a formal substitution letter-by-letter which does not really change the nature of the word). X1 and each entry in X2 and X3 should be quoted, match a necessary type (such as being a character), or be abstracted a level by symbolics. In general, the replacement is formal and the strings in X3 need not be over the same alphabet as the one over which X1 is written. This operator is useful for combinatorial lines and for expanding digits (such as, in a binary string, replacing each occurrence of "0" with "01" and each occurrence of "1" with "10"; note that the replacement is instantaneous and simultaneous for all terms of X2 and every occurrence of such terms in X1, thus this substitution is perfectly acceptable).
bai'i'i	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mekso operator: in ordered tuple/list/vector/sequence X_1, replace the X_2th entry with term X_3 of appropriate type, and leave all other entries untouched (optional: where the index for the very first/leading/header entry is X_4).	X_1 must be some ordered and indexed structure; X_2 must be an index which specifies an entry/element/term which actually appears in X_1; X_3 is an alternative value of appropriate type which can, and after this operation does, replace the X_2th entry/element/term; the counting for indices is according to explicitly specified or implicit cultural convention, or the natural convention for the circumstance, or (when ambiguous or unclear) starts with 1, unless X_4 specifies otherwise (in which case, it is according to that specification). Exactly the X_2th entry is reppaced, and it is replaced with exactly X_3. For example: in (A, B, C), A is the X_4th entry (default: 1st); bai'i'i((A, B, C), 2, b, 1) = (A, b, C). X_2 itself could be replaced with a(n ordered) set of index values, in which case X_3 must be an ordered list of replacement values such that they have the same cardinality; in this situation, the nth index in the index set (according to its ordering) corresponds to an entry in X_1 which gets replaced (respectively) by the nth entry in X_3, where the entries in X_3 are themselves counted/indexed/ordered in the usual manner and with the first/leading/header entry being 1st unless somehow explicitly specified otherwise; the index set is automatically ordered according to the same ordering as on X_3 unless explicitly specified otherwise. Example: bai'i'i((A, B, C, D, E, F, G), Set(5, 2), (b, e), 1) = (A, b, C, D, e, F, G), where the ordering on X_2 and X_3 is the standard ordering starting with 1; note that Set(5, 2) is unordered and that the standard ordering rearranges it as (2, 5) with 2 being the 1st entry/element, meaning that the index 2 (corresponding with B in X_1) gets linked with the first entry of X_3, which is b, meaning that B gets replaced by b in X_1.

Different from {no'e} in that it does not necessarily select a neutral value on a scale; it merely acknowledges that some value on the scale could be chosen/that the scale exists, but does not choose one (it is hands-off). If one does not want to accuse someone of being or doing something, but wants to talk about it, this word would be used; often can be used for "are or are not".

ce'ai	experimental cmavo			   	ZOhU      	lambda variable prenex; marks the end of introduction of lambda-scope variables.	Cf. {zo'u}. In effect this word is used as a shortcut around verbose repeated assignment in a {ka} prenex: lo ka ce'u goi ko'a ce'u goi ko'e ... zo'u ... is the same as lo ka ko'a ko'e ... ce'ai ... In either form this style can be used to avoid subscripting and to disambiguate nested {ka}, {ni}, etc.
ce'au	experimental cmavo			   	JOI      	Formulates periodic ordered list of exactly the connectands in the order presented.	Links together conmectands in a single list until connectives end or get interrupted (say, by a higher-precedent different connective); so "x1 ce'au x2 ce'au x3" produces a single ordered list of period three of form "x1, x2, x3, x1, x2, x3, x1, ... [etc.]". If the list has a natural or known definitive initial state/element (but no such terminating one), then it is the first element which is mentioned; likewise, if the list has a natural or known definitive terminating state/element (but no such initial one), then it is the last item/connectand explicitly mentioned and linked by this word into the same list; both of these are semi-infinite cases. Finite cases have no pressuposed beginning or end state/item. This word is agnostic on whether the list is finite (only finitely many repetitions naturally/are known to occur; arbitrarily many periods/cycles or otherwise), semi-infinite (infinitely many repetitions occur, but there is a definitive start or end state which is natural or known to occur; it is also agnostic, in this case, about which of these options is the applicable one), or doubly-infinite (extends in both directions infinitely; infinitely many cycles, no definitive beginning or end). If exactly two items are linked into the list in total, then the list is 2-periodic: it alternates between the two items (back-and-forth); examples of this would be "on and off" (describing, say, a flickering light), "right, left, right, left, ..." (describing walking), etc. Having exactly three items in the list will produce a list which is 3-periodic and 'rotates' through the items cyclically in order; an example of this would be a description of traffic light signals ("green, yellow, red, green, yellow, red, green, ..."); it does not oscillate/swing back and forth between the explicit 'period endpoints' (so, NOT "green, yellow, red, yellow, green, yellow, red, yellow, green, ...").

The argument is understood to be a point/formal tuple in a space of at least the 'dimensionality' described by n. Its exact behavior depends on context (for example: being next to a formal tuple versus next to a point in, say, a geometric space).

(Use {bo'ai} for more places if needed, or {ce'u} for "next place"). // {cei'e} is meant to be used to define new words (implicit {ca'e}) but may be modified by evidentials to express an assertion ({ju'a}) or opinion ({pe'i}) on a meaning instead.

ce'oi	experimental cmavo			   	JOI      	argument list separator: acts as a comma between arguments in an argument list supplied to a function.	"ce'oi" is the word of choice to separate the arguments in bridi_3. Using {ce'o} there has obvious limitations when the selbri actually calls for a sequence. Obviously, ce'oi has issues too if the selbri can accept an argument list, but this can be circumvented more readily with {ke}...{ke'e} brackets than it can with {ce'o}. Consider ".i lo ka broda cu selbri fi ko'a ce'o ko'e". Without inspecting the type requirements of {broda} and the respective types of {ko'a} and {ko'e}, one cannot determine the meaning of the {bridi}. Furthermore, if one accepts non-static typing of {sumti} places, multiple correct answers can be given for a question asking what is the bridi_1. This would create ambiguity that is otherwise resolved by "ce'oi". See also {ka}, {du'u}, {me'au}

The x_2 place is defined as the thing to which x1 would apply the attitudinal indicator to when using the attitudinal to express the feeling: {mi} ci'au {iu} {do} communicates much the same thing as using {do} {iu} in a bridi.

Not necessarily discrete or unbounded in time, nor (eventually or otherwise) infinitely frequent; as a set of Lebesgue measure 0, it is definitely not "always" ({roroi}) in most contexts.

Let L = length(A); then L is a positive integer, 0, or infinity (countable), and  A = (A_1, A_2, ..., A_L), and B must be a natural number and belong to the ordered interval [1, L]. If L = 0, the output is a placeholder "blank element"; else, if B does not satisfy the aforementioned condition, then the function is undefined. Using the aforementioned notation, and letting Proj represent the projection function, Proj(A, B) = A_B; note that B = 1 will cause the output of the first entry in the tuple, which is A_1. For any i, there is no restriction on the typing/value of A_i so long as it is defined; the type of A_i need not even match the type of A_j for i =/= j. See also: {bai'ei}, {no'au'au}, {pi'ei}. Notice that the input is a single tuple and an integer, it does not rely on anyou underlying stucture; this is markedly different from a the dot product of vectors, although by establishing a basis and an underlying field, they can look quite similar.

"broda co brode do" = "broda co brode be do", however "broda co brode co'ai do" = "broda be do co brode". Overrides the rule that sumti following a tanru with CO belong to the place structure of the right tanru unit. Scope of a single CO; "broda co brode co brodi" would need "co'ai" once to return to "brode" and twice to return to "broda". Proposed rafsi: -cox-. See also: {co}.

This is not merely the assertion that any or some other CO will work (which is the elliptical case: {co'o'e}) nor that some connective between the identity ({co'au'e}) and full ({co}) inverses would do (such as: {co'au'ejoico}, {co'au'ejaco}, etc.; notice that these decompose into two distinct bridi which are connected as indicated). It is the assertion that the utterer does not care which CO is used here or that they are not necessarily asserting one way or the other (in fact, they are actively asserting a neutral or abstaining stance).

The event is being considered somewhat/approximately cyclic in nature on the large scale; the point in question is an end point for one version of going through the cycle once and the point at which the next version begins. The previous cycle need not have reached or exceeded its natural completion/conclusion. This word is useful for when a player restarts a level in a game - the choices made within the level may not be exactly the same, but much of it nonetheless is extremely similar between attempts. "Redouble" may have this meaning. Use this word when one is not at the true (last) end of an event, nor its true (first) beginning, yet is at an end and a begin.

coi'o'e	experimental cmavo			   	UI      	asks the listener to provide a word matching the preceding description being the seltau
co'o	cmavo			   	COI      	vocative: partings/good-bye.
co'o'e	experimental cmavo			   	CO      	elliptical/vague/unspecific/generic tanru inversion	References some (possibly multiple) cmavo in selma'o CO. Unlike most other ellipticals, the default value is not elliptical, so this word cannot be omitted/implicit; it must be explicit.
co'oi	experimental cmavo			   	COI      	Combination of {coi} and {co'o}, indicating either greetings or partings according to context; may also constitute a greeting in passing (such as {coico'o}).	The scalar negated forms of this COI are apparently identical to its positive form. cf. {coi}, {co'o}, {rinsa}, {tolrinsa}.

co'u'a	experimental cmavo			   	ZAhO      	interval event contour: premature cessation; done although not finished; at the ending point of ... even though not completed.	This is a shade of "{co'u}"; whereas "co'u" can cover any cessation (completed or otherwise), this word definitively and affirmatively indicates that completion has not been achieved.

cu'ai	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU3      	binary mathematical operator: vector norm/magnitude of vector a in structure (normed vector space) b.	Contextless default for b: Euclidean normed vector space over the reals or complexes; in relativity, without context, the default interpretation for a four-vector is the Minkowski magnitude. b determines the meaning of the norm. Accompanies and clarifies "{cu'a}".
cu'au	experimental cmavo			   	CUhAU      	universal famyma'o: terminates the most recently opened construct or clause.	cu'au looks back for the most recently opened construct that has not been terminated, and emulates whatever {famyma'o} would terminate it. It can also be subscripted with {xi}, and will terminate that many times. Note that that means grammatical function is being put in a {xi} clause, so be careful when using it. Additionally, cu'au {xi} {ro} will terminate all the way up to the last sentence-starting word (.i mi klama lo zarci pe lo pendo be mi cu'au xi ro -> .i mi klama lo zarci pe lo pendo be mi cu'au-be'o-ku-ge'u-ku-vau). This will also terminate to sentences started in {lu} (will NOT emulate li'u UNLESS used multiple times), {ni'o}, and {no'i}. It will NOT emulate {le'u}. In addition to {ro}, it can be subscripted with {da'a}, which terminates to the sentence level, minus 1. In the previous example, this would just leave the {vau} remaining, and allow you to continue to add to the place structure of {klama}.
cu'au'ei	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mekso binary/unary operator:  multinomial coefficient/binomial coefficient/choose	If unary, a list (n_1,...,n_r) must be supplied as input; the terms of the list may not be distinct; for appropriate values, output is ((n_1 +...+ n_r)!)/((n_1)! *...* (n_r)!). If binary, a single number n must be supplied for the first variable and the second variable must be a list (k_1,...,k_s); for appropriate values, the output is (n!)/((k_1 !) * ((n - k_1)!) *...* (k_s !) * ((n - k_s)!)); note that this is not exactly the typical definition, but it allows for easier immediate usage for the binomial case (where s=1).

Odds n represent the probability of x_1 occurring given x_2 (including human assumptions about the probability/situation); odds are a ratio of probability of success (x_1 occurring) divided by probability of failure (x_2 not occurring). For wagering odds, use "{cu'oi'o}"; for the probability of x_1 occurring, see "{cu'o}"; use "{lau'au}" (mekso operand) in order to convert from odds to probability.

da'a'au	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mekso operatory: prime mark append	For ordered inputs (A, B, C), where A is a general mathematical object, B is an integer (normally nonnegative), and C is a nonnegative integer; appends B prime(s)/distinguishing marks of type C to A. Presumably objects that have the same symbol as A but different B and C values are mutual(ly) related/analogs, but are at least formally distinguishable. B and C each default to 1. In practice, tick marks are usually called prime marks (and probably will effectively/culturally have a value of C=1); other distinguishing features are employed usually once these are used, such as overbars, over-tildes/over-twiddles, dagger, asterisks, etc. For a fixed C, this operator forms a series in B for each A. The meaning is context-specific. B = 0 iff C = 0; if A in unprimed (lacks any distinguishing marks), then B = 0; thus all mathematical objects have this operator implicitly attached to them with the value of 0 for the second and third argumentsize (note that this is not the default value for these arguments when this operator is explicitly mentioned). It is possible therefore to reference both primed and unprimed objects of form A simultaneously via reference to, for example, (1±1)/2 for the value for B and/or C (employing the setting of defaulting to the value of 1 as appropriate).
da'ai	experimental cmavo			   	KOhA3      	other than me	Can include {do}. {ma'a} can be defined as "{mi} {jo'u} {do} jo'u {da'ai}"
da'ai'a	experimental cmavo			   	BAI      	"da'avni" modal: except under condition ...; unless ...; excepting/exempting (condition) ... .	See also: "{da'avni}". Use "{teda'ai'a}" for "except if/in [condition implicit], in which case ...". Can be nested via inclusion of another "da'ai'a" within the condition which is filling the sumti slot which was introduced by the higher-level instance of this word; for example: "every Gregorian year with label which is divisible by 4 unless (it is also divisible by 100 unless (it is also divisible by 400)) is a leap year", where parenthesis denote the sumti slot and the second "unless" is nested, meaning that uears which are a multiple of 400 are indeed leap years, despite being divisible by 100 as well – in this example, "unless" would be translated by this word.

Each usage acts as though the scope of all previous usages have been closed/terminated (or that all assignments to the meaning of this word have been forgotten/erased/overridden/unassigned). Even within the same given scope, multiple usages of this word can refer to different things (with or without qualification) and are (modulo qualification) completely free in their reference sets absolutely and with respect to one another; of course, they can mean the same thing, but it is not necessary. Usage within prenexes is essentially pointless if intended to be used after the same. See also: {da'o}, {da}, {kau'a}, {kau'e}, {kau'i}, {zo'e}.

The terbri are not filled by this word. Usage is only meaningful for a brivla with at least one terbri (regardless of being explicitly filled or otherwise). In a tanru or other complicated construct, only the most recent word undergoes this terbri default restoration (not every term in the construct). A selbri converted to a sumti by gadri has the x1 terbri filled for the purposes of this word, but the default setting of that terbri is so restored all the same; likewise is the case for terbri accessed by {be} or {bei}; seltau in the main level of a sumti are filled by the gadri as well for the purposes of this word.

dau'o	experimental cmavo			   	DAUhO      	Quantifier modifier: endowment of existential import - repeal of existential import/abstention from claiming existence - assertion of non-existence	The immediately previous word must be a quantifier (such as {ro}) or quantified variable. This word endows the quantification with existential import. If this word is immediately followed by "{cu'i}" (thereby producing "{dau'ocu'i}"), then all existential import is explicitly repealed (so that it does not apply) and the result is agnostic on existence; "{rodau'o}" is technically exactly the same as "{ro}" alone according to the CLL and means "(for) each/every/all [x, P(x) is true], and strictly more than zero [x] (are asserted to) exist"; meanwhile, "{rodau'ocu'i}" is a more correct translation of the universal quantifier ("all", "for any/every") in modern logic/math, but it very clearly states that the person is purposefully and knowingly abstaining from asserting existence of non-existence. If it is immediately followed by "{nai}" (thereby producing "{dau'onai}"), then non-existence is explicitly, purposefully, and knowingly claimed; the result is more of an 'IF' statement ("if X were to exist, then proposition p(X) would be true (of (all of) X); but X do not exist."). On its own, "{rodau'o} lo broda cu brode" is equivalent to "ro lo broda cu brode .ije da broda".

de'ai	experimental cmavo			   	DEhAI      	default value (re)specification/(re)assignment/(re)definition/over-write; set new default value (terbri-specific; permanent)	Terminates immediately previous sumti.  The immediately following (next) unfilled terbri at that level of nesting is affected by this word; if no such terbri exists at that level of nesting, this word's affects apply to the next unfilled terbri in the immediately higher level of nesting (unnested once); if no unfilled terbri exist at any/all levels of nesting and following the immediately previous sumti (even if unfilled terbri exist prior to that sumti), this word has no meaningful affect and can be ignored.  This word must be followed by a sumti; for the purpose of this explanation, this sumti will be xy (as in "de'ai xy").  The affected terbri is defined to default to the value xy (the sumti as a whole, including gadri, tanru, relative clauses, etc.); in other words, when not explicitly filled or when filled be {di'au}, the sumti value filling the affected terbri is that of xy.  This affect remains in effect until the end of the text/conversation or until/unless the default setting of this terbri explicitly redefined (overriding by {di'ei} is temporary/only applies to that usage). If xy is {zo'e}, the default value is completely general and elliptical; thus, permanently overriding a default setting on a specific terbri may be done by "de'ai zo'e". The scope of this word fully encompasses and ends with the following sumti (xy); thus, the second sumti, same-/higher-level terminator, a FA cmavo, etc. following this word ends the new default specification in addition to its other functions.  Additionally, this word does not actually fill the affected terbri with any particular sumti/value; it merely defines its default value hereinafter. CAUTION: Thus, the second same-level sumti uttered actually fills the affected terbri; in order to access the newly-defined default value of the terbri immediately after definition, follow "xy" (with terminator) immediately with implicit (or possibly explicit) "{zo'e}" (possibly necessitating terminators), "{di'au}", or "xy" itself. Moreover, therefore, the default value defined by this word does not immediately/necessarily affect the truth value of the statement in which it appears (it only does so if the second following sumti is not {di'au}, implicit (or possibly) explicit {zo'e}, or xy itself); however, in all future uses of the brivla to which the terbri belongs, unless explicitly filled with a sumti of a different value, the truth value of those statements will be affected.  Also, {su} does not erase this new definition of default. If the affected terbri is naturally defined to have a default or if it has no naturally defined default value, this word semi-permanently over-writes them. See also: {dai'o}, {de'au}, {de'ei}, {de'oi}, {di'au}, {di'ei}, {di'oi}.

A selbri converted to a sumti by gadri has the x1 terbri filled for the purposes of this word, but the default setting of that terbri is so overridden all the same; likewise is the case for terbri accessed by {be} or {bei}; seltau in the main level of a sumti are filled by the gadri as well for the purposes of this word. The cancellation is only effective for the single occurrence/instant/usage of this word (the next use of the affected word will be implicitly accompanied by its terbri defaults, as defined elsewhere (by official definition or by other (permanent) modifications made to the word)).

di'au	experimental cmavo			   	KOhA7      	pro-sumti and sumyzmico: discourse-interior default it (terbri-specific)	Explicitly and emphatically references the specified default value of the relevant terbri as specified/designated by the discourse; thus, its value is context-dependent and subject to specification modifications. It does not necessarily reference the value defined "officially". ({zo'e}, implicit or explicit, may do so as well, but the use of this word implies some degree of a more deliberate choice to follow the default specification.) When a default of the terbri is not specified by the previous discourse (nor by the discourse-exterior "official" definition of the terbri if not specification modifications have been made previously), this word is equivalent to completely general and elliptical {zo'e}. See also: {di'oi}, {di'ei}.

Thus, there is no simple way to reference the "general" elliptical/unspecified value for these sumti, other than by using this word.  {zo'e} typically is interpreted as meaning any value of some general and unspecified set of potential sumti referents, modulated by context and the need to make the statement true; in the case of an explicit default setting of a terbri by the definition of a word, {di'ei} takes on this general and unspecified meaning, effectively ignoring the default (although it can take on the value of that default (doing so, simply, is just not necessary)); when no default is specified for the terbri in the definition, this word has the same meaning as {zo'e}.

(zo'e, implicit or explicit, may do so as well, but the use of this word implies some degree of a more deliberate choice to follow the discourse-exterior default specification.) When a default is not specified by the definition of a word, this word is equivalent to completely general and elliptical {zo'e}. See also: {di'au}, {di'ei}, {zmico}.

Resets all defaults (default specifications) in the (terbri) structure of immediately previously uttered word so that implicit/omitted {zo'e} and {di'au} that may fill the terbri of that word are predefined/specific in reference and do indeed necessarily agree with the default setting explicitly specified in the discourse-exterior/”official” definition of the word. The terbri are not filled by this word. Usage is only meaningful for a brivla with at least one terbri (regardless of being explicitly filled or otherwise). In a tanru or other complicated construct, only the most recent word undergoes this terbri default restoration (not every term in the construct).

Operators or symbolic orderings (rather than a description thereof) must be submitted via {mau'au}-{zai'ai} quotes. Usually, X_1 must be included; X_1 must be a set. Definitions and axioms must be defined elsewhere. An operator or ordering which is undefined on the set X_1 produces a trivial structure (one which is identical to that which is formed if this operator/ordering were not included at all).

If X_1 is not provided explicitly here by a {du'a'e} construct, then one must be inferred from context (the most recent definition; the order of things entries submitted to that construct is understood to apply here via direct formal substitution); otherwise, this word is undefined.  Even though operators and orders must be submitted to {de'a'e} via {zai'ai}-{mau'au} quotes, they are extracted naked by this word (so that they can be used directly as evaluating operators in numerical expressions; thus, they must be requoted if that is desired/appropriate). Counting starts at 1. Thus, X_2 being exactly the singleton of 1 will output the underlying set of X_1.

fa'ai	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mathematical ordered n-ary operator: (pointwise) functional left composition; X_1 \\circ X_2.	Inputs must be appropriate functions; this outputs a function; follow by "{ku'e} ({boi})" in order to include/apply the output function to arguments (thereby producing a number). a_1 \\circ a_2 \\circ \\dots \\circ a_n = a_1(a_2(\\dots(a_n(\\cdot))\\dots)) for any positive integer or countable infinity n and functions a_i for all integer i < n+1. Replaces all of the inputs with a (possibly stripped, as appropriate) tuple; for replacing a single argument in a multivariate function with a function (either evaluated or not), use (partial) (e)valuation. Left compose multiple terms by separating the function names with "{boi}".
fa'ai'ai	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mekso k-ary operator, for natural k and 1 < k < 5: ordered input (f, g, S, m) where f and g are functions, S is a set of positive integers or "ro" (="all"), and m is 0 or 1 (as a toggle); output is a function equivalent to the function f as applied to an input ordered tuple with g applied to the entries/terms with indices in S (or to all entries/terms if S="ro") if m=0, or g left-composed with the same if m=1.	S="ro" is default case (making this operator binary or ternary); S must be a set or "ro" (no bare integers); m = 0 is the default case (making this operator binary or ternary); use "{mau'au}" and "{zai'ai}" in order to quote f and g each; the indices in the implicit tuple mentioned in the definition are positive natural numbers such that said tuple is of form (x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n, ...); thus, notationally, a concrete output of this function, as applied to the aforementioned concrete input tuple, is of form (fa'ai'ai(f, g, S, m))(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, ...). For example, maintaining this notation, if S="ro" and m=0, then the output is f(g(x_1), g(x_2), ..., g(x_n), ...); if S = Set(1, 3, 23) and m=0, then the output is f(g(x_1), x_2, g(x_3), x_4, x_5, ..., x_21, x_22, g(x_23), x_24, x_25, ..., x_n, ...); vel sim. If h is the function output by this expression when m=0, then for the same inputs (ignoring m), g \\circ h is the function output by the same expression but with m=1. Obviously, in order to be meaningful, the output of each step along the way must be defined. If S is the empty set and g is defined, then the output is just the function f if m=0. The output of this operator is a function, so it must have explicit input supplied to it ("it" here referring to the output of this operator) in order to actually have an explicit and concrete result; use mathematical brackets around this operator and its inputs when doing so, particularly when S or m is omitted (as being equal to the default "ro" or 0 resp.).
fa'au	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mathematical unary operator: map notation	Input is unary: a function f; the output is an ordered tuple: (the domain set of f, the codomain set of f, the image of f, the mapping rule of f (defined with a dummy variable which is taken to belong to the the domain set of f), the graph/plot (set of input-output pairs) of f). Might be useful for lambda calculus, etc. Equip the output with {ma'o} in order to use as a/the function. Extract a term in the tuple in order to use it directly.

Also may indicate a cultural or linguistic gap. For Lojban especially, it might be useful when various ambiguities arise in the original text and the translator is forced to pick interpretations from among them.

fau'a	experimental cmavo			   	FAUhA      	Convert operator to being entrywise.	Applied to an operator by immediately following it; breaks the symmetry which that operator may have had: the first argument of the operator is to be a tensor or (multidimensional) list, or a set, or something with many internal terms, entries, elements, components, etc; the subsequent arguments of the operator are arbitrary. The result is to apply the operator with the subsequent arguments to each term, entry, elements, etc. of the first argument individually. For example, for matrix A=((1, 2), (3, 4)), A+(fau'a)10 = ((11, 12),(13, 14)) and A^2 = ((7, 10), (15, 22)); however, A^(fau'a)2 = ((1, 4), (9, 16)); likewise, sin(A) = A - (1/3)A^3 + (1/5)A^5 - ..., but sin(fau'a)(A) = ((sin(1), sin(2)), (sin(3), sin(4))), which is meant to show the distribution of the sin() function to each entry of A, although it also happens to be equivalent to applying the Taylor expansion to A via "fau'a" as well. Caution must be used: matrix addition or scalar multiplication of matrices already have this distributional property, so this word is not needed in those cases; in fact, A+(fau'a)A would yield ((1+A, 2+A), (3+A, 4+A)), which is nonsensical (because, without "fau'a", the addition of a scalar entry to a matrix is undefined).
fa'u'ai	experimental cmavo			   	JOI      	non-logical connective: antirespectively; unmixed but reverse ordered distributed association.	Works together with {fa'u}; given an ordering by {fa'u}, the terms connected by this word are (applied) in opposite order.
fau'ai	experimental cmavo			   	FAUhA      	Iteratively applies "fau'a" to each resultant operator until all operators resolve.	Let matrix A = ((1, 2), (3, 4)); then A +(fau'ai) A = A +({fau'a}*) A = ((1 +(fau'a*) A, 2 +(fau'a*) A), (3 +(fau'a*) A, 4 +(fau'a*) A)) = (( ((1+1, 1+2), (1+3, 1+4)), ((2+1, 2+2),(2+3, 2+4)) ), ( ((3+1, 3+2), (3+3, 3+4)), ((4+1, 4+2), (4+3, 4+4)) )), which has all of the additions resolve (so the iteration terminates) - the result is a 2-by-2 matrix in which each entry is itself a 2-by-2 matrix. If the operators resolve after differing iteration counts, then the process continues only on the unresolved ones with the resolved ones being held constant and saved.
fau'au	experimental cmavo			   	JAhOI      	two-tier function map/assignment writer notation: X1 (ordered list, no repetitious terms) maps termwise-respectively to X2 (ordered list; may be repetitious but must have exactly as many terms as X1)	So named because, in mathematical notation, the domain set of the function is written down in some order in its entirety and then, below it, the range of the function is written so that each image and preimage line up vertically with their appropriate/respective partner. Really useful when mapping from a countable set/object that is either human-small or in which the pattern is clear. Occasionally used for a more explicit form of notation for permutations (in which cycle decomposition is not necessarily as evident, but the structure as a how is, at least, explicit). The ith term of X1 is mapped to the ith term of X2; there is no knowledge of what happens to any value that is not term of list X1.  Useful for lambda calculus.
fau'e	experimental cmavo			   	XI      	iterated function left-composition with self: f∘f∘...∘f, n times.	First argument must be a function(al) or some object f that can be left-composed with itself (and which is unary); second argument is a real number (usually nonnegative integer) n for which n compositions of f makes sense; the result is f left-composed with itself n times and, as such, is itself a function(al) or other object of the same sort as f (therefore, it can then be applied to an m-tuple input, where m is less than or equal to the arity of f; if f is a function, then the output will generally not be a number in the codomain of f, but rather a function itself). This word is a shortcut for longer expressions. See also: {fa'ai}, {se'au}, {te'a}, {fe'a}.
fau'i	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mekso ternary operator: inverse function of input function X_1 with respect to its input X_2, taken on branch or restricted domain X_3 ("domain" being of X_1).	The output of this function is itself a function of the same arity as X_1. X_3 often omitted due to obviousness (or due to lack of need/due to well-definition) or convention. X_1 should be a function supplied in "{zau'au}" quotes; that function itself should be at least unary and the input against which the inverse is being taken in an n-ary X_1 is X_2. X_2 should technically be a input slot index or domain (or subspace/projection thereof), but a named and non-evaluated dummy variable symbol can be supplied if the slot ordering or domain terms (vel sim.) are not well-specified. Because the output is a function, it can itself (that is: the output's self) have an input; use "{bai'i'i}" or an equivalent thereof for this purpose in most situations. For example, if f(x,y,z)=w,g=fau'i(f,2),v=(x,y,z), and u=bai'i'i(v,2,w)=(x,w,z), then g(u)=f^{-1}_2(x,w,z)=y. In English notation, "fau'i(f,n)" might be notated as "inv(f,n)". See also: "{fau'e}" (this word acts as a better-specified case of iteration order n=-1 for "fau'e").

Units are not considered to be prime factors. B toggles the type of counting: If B=0, then the prime factors are counted without multiplicity (they are counted only uniquely, ignoring their exponents); if B=1, then multiple factors of the same prime are counted (the exponents of the prime factors are added together); no other option for the value of B is currently defined; B might have contextual/cultural/conventional defaults but the contextless default value is B=1.

fi'au	experimental cmavo			      		mekso operator: continued fraction, Kettenbruch notation; for ordered input (X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4), where: X_1 is an ordered pair of functions and X_2 is a free or dummy variable/input/index which ranges through set X_3 in order(ing) X_4, the result is K_{(X_2, (X_3, X_4))} (X_1(X_2)) for Kettenbruch notation K.	X_1 will be an ordered pair of functions defined on X_3 and with input X_2. Let X_1 = (a, b) where 'a' and b are each functions (defined on X_3), X_3 be the set of all nonnegative integers which are strictly less than some positive integer or positive infinity (denoted by "n+1") as determined by the context/problem, and X_4 be the standard ordering on X_3; then the output will be: a(0) + b(0)/(a(1) + b(1)/(a(2) + b(2)/(.../(a(n-1) + b(n-1)/(a(n) + b(n)))))), where division has higher operator priority than addition and where, if n is positive infinity, then the expression never terminates and convergence of subfractions is necessary for well-definition; the inputs of 'a' and b technically can be ordered tuples so long as they symbolically include X_2 and all other parameters are specified.  In general, a(min(X_3)), for min being defined according to the ordering X_4, will be the formally 'integer'-part of the expression (even if it evaluates to a fraction) - in other words, it is the number which is entirely outside of the nested fractions. This operator is intended to be maximally general; some definition for X_3 being the empty set can be devised, or 'a' or b could be function-valued or otherwise exotic-valued functions (so long as their outputs have sum, division, and closure properties), etc. See also: "{se'au}". If diphthong "eu" is ever accepted into Lojban, this definition would preferably be moved to "{fi'eu}" (because the "eu" would also be etymologically tied to "Kettenbruch", and the "au" diphthong is more basic and should be reserved for higher-priority words).

ge'ai	experimental cmavo			   	ZOhU      	metasyntactic variable prenex	Explicitly marks variables, e.g. ko'a ko'e, lerfu-strings, and/or brodV (must be converted into sumti using {me'ei}) as being metasyntactic: i.e. having no specific meaning or referent and merely used to demonstrate syntax or hypothetical scenarios. Automatically unassigns these variables from any previous assignment. e.g. (me'ei broda me'ei brode ko'a ko'e fo'a fo'e ge'ai). See {ge'ei}, {ce'ai}, {ke'au}, {zo'u}, {da'o}
ge'e	cmavo			   	UI6      	attitudinal: elliptical/unspecified/non-specific emotion; no particular feeling.
ge'ei	experimental cmavo			   	UI3a      	metasyntactic variable marker	Explicitly marks the preceding variable, e.g. ko'a ko'e, lerfu-strings, and/or {broda} series as being metasyntactic: i.e. having no specific meaning or referent and merely used to demonstrate syntax or hypothetical scenarios. Automatically unassigns the variable from any previous assignment. May also be used for pronouns like {mi} or {do} or {dei}. This is useful to refer to {mi} as a 'first-person pronoun' rather than the actual speaker themself, for example, when giving the definition of {mi'o}: '{mi} {ge'ei} {jo'u} {do} {ge'ei}', makes it clear that the speaker doesn't literally mean the speaker and the listener, but are using {mi} and {do} metasyntactically. Similarly, one might define {mi} as '{lo} {cusku} {be} {dei} {ge'ei}'. See {ge'ai}, {da'o}

Notice that it produces a string of digits; the meaning of this string must be established by processing through JUhU or the like. The input must also be a string of digits (not a number). Useful for certain algorithms, such as an nth root algorithm.

In case of nesting, the innermost connective is targeted, unless a subscript specifies otherwise: in "ge X gi tu'a ga Y gi gibu", gibu refers to Y. "gibu xi re" may be used to refer to the second-innermost referent, X. See {nu bu}.
gi'e	cmavo			   	GIhA      	logical connective: bridi-tail afterthought and.
gi'ei	experimental cmavo			   	GIhEI      	afterthought abstraction wrapper	Accepts 'gi'ei LE NU', 'gi'ei NU' (elided LE defaults to {lo}), or 'gi'ei LOhOI'. Wraps the bridi before it within an abstraction. e.g. 'mi klama le zarci gi'ei-le-nu cabna lo nu do klama' = 'le nu mi klama le zarci cu cabna lo nu do klama'. Also see {xoi}, {jai'i}. Grammar note: The {gi'ei}-group acts like a specialized {vau}, grabbing a single bridi. If you are in a sub-bridi of the bridi you wish to convert, you need to close the sub-bridi with {vau}, or use {i'au} to return to the top bridi of the sentence.

gi'o'i	experimental cmavo			   	GOhA      	pro-bridi: in the second half of a bridi forethought connective expression, refers to the first half.	For example: in "ga mi broda do gi ta na gi'o'i", gi'o'i refers to "(mi) broda do". In case of nesting, the innermost connective is targeted, unless a subscript specifies otherwise: in "ge mi broda gi ga do brode gi gi'o'i", gi'o'i refers to "do brode". "gi'o'i xi re" may be used to refer to the second-innermost referent, "mi broda".
gi'oi	experimental cmavo			   	GIhOI      	This cmavo precedes a predicate (at least binary) and turns it into a forethought conjunction, which syntactically behaves like GA cmavo. The predicate indicates the relationship between the two connected propositions. Terminator: {te'u}.	This is the forethought version of {ji'oi}.

go'a	cmavo			   	GOhA      	pro-bridi: repeats a recent bridi (usually not the last 2).
go'ai	experimental cmavo			   	GOhA      	last bridi (with its modifiers)	Repeats the immediately preceding bridi as "{go'i}" does but with all of the modifiers made in the same, particularly negations/affirmations, excluding "{xu}". All referents remain the same unless they are explicitly changed or restated, or the word "{ra'o}" is used. If the previous bridi (say, a true-false question) were phrased in the negative, then this word would answer in the negative (whereas "go'i" would answer in the positive), and "{nago'ai}" would answer in the affirmative (whereas "nago'i" would answer in the negative). This word nontrivially couples with "{nei'ai}" in the case of the referent bridi being phrased negatively. Subscripting this word with an integer n causes the referent sentence to be earlier than the current bridi by exactly a count of n; n = 0 implies reference to the current bridi, n = +1 implies reference to the immediately preceding bridi (this is the default), n = -1 implies reference to the immediately subsequent bridi, n > 0 implies reference to some previously uttered bridi, n < 0 implies reference to some future bridi.
go'au	experimental cmavo			   	COI2      	marks the tagged sumti as being scope-wide within the immediate parent (text-wide by default) specified in the argument of the vocative	'{go'au} {do'u}' is an in-thought in-place way to specify global constants or variables as opposed to forethought ways.
go'e	cmavo			   	GOhA      	pro-bridi: repeats the next to last bridi.
go'i	cmavo			   	GOhA      	pro-bridi: preceding bridi; in answer to a yes/no question, repeats the claim, meaning yes.

goi'e	experimental cmavo			   	COI3      	assign sentence or tu'e...tu'u group to sumti	Works like {cei'e}, but assigns the abstraction involving the associated sentence(s) to a sumti variable. E.g. (goi'e ko'a mi tavla do) assigns (lo su'u mi tavla do) to {ko'a}. Use {lu'e} on the assigned variable to refer to the text itself. See {goi}, {cei}

If applied to an element of an algebraic structure, one has the options to specify the structure in which its order is being considered and/or the operator with respect to which its order is being considered (for example, in a given ring, an elements additive order is usually not its multiplicative order), although either of these made remain vague and be inferred from context; order is the smallest non-negative number of applications of the operator needed to be applied (in composition) to the original element in order for it to result in the identity element of the structure (thus, order is not always finite or even defined).

i'au	experimental cmavo			   	IhAU      	reset bridi-level to zero	Auto-inserts all necessary terminators to reset to the top-level bridi of the sentence (i.e. everything that {i} would insert except the last {vau}). This is useful if you have opened multiple NU/NOI subclauses, and just want to close them all to add more sumti, terms, or a {xoi} clause to the main bridi without using a bunch of terminators. // May also be used with UI-cmavo. UI-cmavo placed immediately after {i'au} would scope over the entire sentence. This is useful for attaching attitudinals as afterthoughts, without having to close the entire sentence manually with the right number of {vau}s. See {ji'au}, {fu'e}, {fu'o}.

Example usage: lo tadni cu jai'a lu'o sruri lo dinju gi'e krixa <-> loi tadni cu sruri lo dinju gi'e jai'a lu'a krixa <-> loi tadni cu sruri lo dinju .ije lu'a lo go'i cu krixa

jai'e	experimental cmavo			   	JAI      	elliptical presence or absence of "jai".	If used without a sumtcita, the meaning is that the information about presence or absence of a "jai" has been left to context. "lo se pensi be mi cu jai'e jitfa" = "lo se pensi be mi cu jitfa gi'a jai jitfa". In cases where it is questionable whether or not a "jai" is needed for sumti raising, but the meaning is clear, this word can be used to bypass Lojban's very strict sumti raising semantics. Regardless of which of the two alternative meanings is then applied, the fai-place always contains the original x1. When used with a sumtcita, the meaning is identical to "jai". See also {jai}, {tu'a}, {fai}.

ja'oi	experimental cmavo			   	JAhOI      	permutation cycle writer notation start	Basically like {jo'i}, but for cycles. Use {boi} in order to separate terms.  Terminated by {tei'u}. In this notation, each term maps to the the subsequent term as read from left to right or heard in chronological order of utterance; the last term (immediately before {tei'u}) maps to the first term. The object constructed is a cyclic permutation, a group element. The singleton cycle is identity on that term. It can be applied to a single element among its terms or may left group act upon a set or structure, or an element if the application is not directly upon it (such as when the application is to an index or variable of that element). Permutations are composed when viewed from outside of their group structure and have the group operator act upon them when within that context. The transposition (1  2) is expressed as ' li ja'oi pa boi re tei'u '. See also: {tei'u}, {ma'o'e}, {gu'ai}, {ru'ei}, {fa'ai}.

If the question type is {xu} then it is synonymous with some construction using the U truth function, e.g. "mi pendo do ja'u lo du'u xu kau do ricfu" = "mi pendo do i ju do ricfu". In fact it should not be used with {xu} since the U truth function is much shorter. It is designed to be used with all other question types. For example, "mi na kakne lo ka smusku kei ja'u lo du'u ma kau bangu", for which there only exists the paraphrase: "no da poi bangu zo'u mi kakne lo ka smusku kei bau da". It is also designed to be used with a {ni} or {jei} abstraction ("jei" in this case being mostly synonymous with "du'u xu kau"), e.g. "mi ba jinga ja'u lo ni lo drata cu troci". See also: {du'u}, {na'e}, {fancuka}, {ni}, {jei}, {u}, {ju}, {gi'u}, {gu'u}, {gu}.

For a tuple/vector/array/matrix/tensor, the number of entries/conponents is counted. Not literally the number of symbols used, but the number of meaningful "spots" occupied; for example "(1,0)" uses five characters, but its length is just 2 (for "1" and then "0"); this is due to the fact that formal representation may vary but the amount of information conveyed must remain constant. Note that digit strings are essentially considered to be vectors in the basis of powers of the base.

Useful for asking about how to say a certain thing (which can be indicated or acted out) or for memes; in writing, it would often be expressed via a colon (":") in English. It would be used for, at the very least, the final colon in the caption to this image: https://photos.app.goo.gl/M6y4fhCy32sgi5No8 , but possibly for the others as well. Neither expression on either side of this word (from the immediately previous ".i" or the beginning of the text, whichever is closer, to the immediately following ".i" or the end of the text, whichever is closer) need be grammatical; the information which is conveyed subsequent to this word may not even be linguistic.

ji'i'u	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mekso, at-most-5-ary operator: a rounding function; ordered input list is (x,n,t,m,b) and the output is sgn(x) b^{t} round_{n} (b^{(-t)} abs(x)), with rounding preference n and where the fractional part of b^{(-t)} abs(x) being equal to 1/2 causes the round_{n} ( ) function to map b^{(-t)} abs(x) to the nearest integer of form 2Z+m, for base b (determined by context if not explicitly input) and some integer Z (determined by context).	This function rounds x toward or away from 0; if you want a complementary function which rounds toward positive or negative infinity, then see "{ji'i'u'u}". x must be a real number; & n must be exactly one of exactly the following: -1, 0, 1; & t must be an integer (contextless default: 0) if defined at all (see infra); & m must be 0 xor 1 if it is defined at all (see infra); & b is a numerical base (if determined by context) or is a nonzero real number (if explicitly specified), see infra; the output is a real (typically: rational) number. n does not have a contextless default value; it determines the type of rounding which is to be used here (see infra). m is defined iff n = 0; if m is/would be undefined, then its slot is automatically and implicitly deleted from this word in that context (so the operator is at-most-4-ary and the the final argument would fill the 't' xor 'b' slot under the condition that three xor four (resp.) arguments are explicitly used). If m is defined, then its contextless default value is m = 0. This function/word first determines the base being used for interpretation of digit strings (determined by context or by explicit specification (JUhAU)) for/as applied to x; this determination takes place even before inputs are accepted after x; let this base be represented by b throughout this description unless b is explicitly specified as an input. In such case, if the base of x is a positional system wherein each digit represents a corresponding multiple of a fixed natural number raised to the power of its position (as determined relative to the radix point) and wherein the overall number is the sum of these results/representands, or if b is explicitly specified as an input, then t is defined; if the base of x is sufficiently bad or unclear and b is not explicitly specified as an input, then t is undefined. Of course, if b is explicitly specified as an input, then that value (if valid) is the meaning of "b" throughout this description. If t is undefined, then its slot is automatically and implicitly deleted from this word in that context (so the operator is at-most-3-ary and its input acceptance is terminated by the 'n' xor 'm' slot, whichever one is later yet defined (because, assumptively, 'b' is not explicitly specified); if 'm' is defined and explicitly uttered when 't' is undefined and the 'x' and 'n' values have been explicitly specified, then the third input is 'm') and "b^t" = "b^{(-t)}" = b = 1 formally for the purposes of this definition (but not necessarily for the base for any digit-to-number interpretation/conversion, particularly on x!). If t is defined, then its contextless default value is t = 0. The rounding function, determined by n, is performed on (b^{(-t)})abs(x). If n = 1, then the rounding function is the ceiling function: (b^{(-t)})abs(x) is mapped to the least integer that is greater than or equal to it; in other words, it rounds up. If n = -1, then the rounding function is the floor function: (b^{(-t)})abs(x) is mapped to the greatest integer that is less than or equal to it; in other words, it rounds down. These integers are both determined by the ordering and metric. If n = 0, then the rounding function maps (b^{(-t)})abs(x) to the integer that minimizes the metric distance between itself and (b^{(-t)})abs(x) if a unique such integer exists (id est: (b^{(-t)})abs(x) is mapped to the nearest integer, where "nearest"-ness is determined according to the order and metric); if no such unique integer exists, then (b^{(-t)})abs(x) is mapped to the unique integer among these aforementioned options for which there exists an integer Z such that 2Z+m is the integer in question; if no unique such integer exists, then the function is undefined. Thus, n = 0 produces the commonly used unbiased nearest-integer rounding function. In each of these cases, the output of the rounding function is then multiplied by sgn(x) b^{t}. Thus, it rounds at the tth digit if b matches the base of x and else to the nearest multiple of b in the tth digit of abs(x), so to speak. Notice that rounding up or down always is applied to the absolute value, so it is really rounding (positive or negative) infinity-ward or zeroward respectively. The order on, and the operators and metric endowing, the metric space and field of all real numbers is determined by context or by explicit specification. The absolute value function is denoted as "abs( )" in the definition, and the signum function sgn is such that sgn(z) = z/abs(z) for all real z: abs(z) > 0, and sgn(0) = 0.
ji'i'u'u	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mekso, at-most-5-ary; rounding function. (See notes).	This word is mathematically equivalent to "{ji'i'u}", except that every occurrence of "abs(x)" in its definition is here replaced simply with "x" and every occurrence of "sgn(x)" in its definition is here replaced with "1". In other words, where "ji'i'u" really rounds toward or away from 0, this word rounds toward negative or positive infinity. The behaviors coincide for nonnegative x, but differ for x < 0; for example, for x < 0, a 'negative-type' rounding for "ji'i'u" would round toward 0, which is actually an increase in value (just decrease in absolute value) while remaining negative, whereas a 'negative-type' rounding here would round toward negative infinity, which is a decrease in value (but an increase in absolute value) while remaining negative. This function corresponds more closely with a simple floor or ceiling function, but can be annoying in certain common contexts due to the need to define behavior involving it piecewisely for negative x.

Likewise, someone travelling northwestward is not travelling (due) northward AND (due) westward, nor are they travelling (due) northward OR (due) westward; they are travelling a mixture of both. It can also be used for answering "yes"/"no" questions; it may or may noy be helpful in this role, but it is distinct from an elliptical or non-definitive answer.

ju'au	experimental cmavo			   	JUhAU      	semi-mathematical binary operator: named number base operator/interpreter	Follows a number and is followed by a sumti string (introduced with appropriate gadri, multiple sumti strung together via connectives); scope terminates with the end of the sumti and/or with {ke'e'au}. The construct as a whole syntactically functions as a parenthetical so that mekso may be resumed immediately thereafter without any difficulty. This word attaches to/affects the immediately preceding macrodigit string extending from the last evaluated number, number operation, etc. or bracket to/until this word. The preceding number is semantically interpreted according to the description to which the following sumti refers. If a sequence is supplied as the following sumti, the preceding number is interpreted so that each digit, starting from the left (default: see next), is understood as a multiple of the corresponding value in the sequence under the ordering given (which may produce an invalid/ill-formed result; the placement of {pi} matters as well).  If a single number is submitted (such as "li {dau}"), this word acts as {ju'u}; the number is interpreted according to the rules of mekso and is its own island for such interpretation (thus {ju'u} is needed to override a cultural/grammatical default interpretation, such as decimal, even if this is done within the mekso expression outside of and including the scope of this word). In this way, the sumti being (10^n)_n, which is a sequence, is the same as the sumti being just 10, but is very different from it being the sequence (10)_n.  The original default for numeral-position/string reading/interpretation is from left-to-right, where a digit on the left in a pair of digits represents that multiple of a "later" term in the sequence as compared to right member of the pair; thus "23" in decimal means (2*(10^1)) + (3*(10^0)), which is twenty-three.  This default may be overridden via specification of the sequence (either its ordering, its domain being negated, or alteration to the base); alternatively, and perhaps more easily, the appearance of "la'e zoi jbo. ri'u bi'o zu'a .jbo" will always reverse it (this is a special input value with interpretation defined by this grammar); when reversed, "23" in decimal means (2*(10^0)) + (3*(10^1)), which is to say thirty-two.  Generally, this word overrides the default interpretation of a string of microdigits when computing the value of a macrodigit (see: {ju'u'i}). See also: {ju'u}, {ju'u'i}, {pi'e}.

ju'u	cmavo			   	VUhU2      	binary mathematical operator: number base; [a interpreted in the base b].
ju'u'i	experimental cmavo			   	JUhUhI      	long-digit interpretation specifier; macrodigit named base specifier	When a string of multiple digits is on either side of {pi'e}, the string is to be interpreted as a single "macrodigit" in the longer numeric string; let the digits that compose it be called "microdigits" for clarity. By default, the macrodigit is interpreted as being written/expressed in some cultural or grammatical default (this default is overridden by {ju'au} if its specifying sumti requires an alternative interpretation for the value of the macrodigits), probably decimal- the interpretation of the string of microdigits produces a number, x; the "{pi'e}" implies the denominator to be used in determining the fraction for which x is in the numerator and context or possibly a specified base determines its value- in timekeeping, the interpretation is typically x/60 for certain macrodigits. However, the default for determining the value of x given a string of microdigits might be useful to override (for example, Tsohnai uses an overall factorial base but each macrodigit is written in balanced quinary); this word specifies the base used for interpreting the macrodigit from a string of microdigits. It is placed at the end of the string (possibly before the next "{pi'e}") and its scope of effect extends from there, through the string of microdigits, to either the beginning of the number as a whole or the most recent "{pi'e}" (whichsoever was more recently uttered). It is to be followed by a sumti (or multiple sumti strung together by connectives) and has its scope of specification terminate with that sumti; in this regard, it works syntactically and semantically exactly like {ju'au}. In fact, {ju'au} can be used outside of the number in order to specify the macrodigit interpretation instead of this word (for example, if its sumti were la .tsonais., this word would not be needed); however, if only a sequence were to have been given as the argument of {ju'au} (such as the factorial sequence) and if some base other than decimal were desired for the interpretation of each macrodigit from the string of microdigits, then this word would be used. If only one macrodigit appears in the number, then this word is equivalent to {ju'au}. In short, the scope of this word is one contiguous string of microdigits, and it influences their interpretation into a macrodigit value in the same way that {ju'au} does. However, if both {ju'au} and this word specify how to interpret a given string of microdigits in the same number (composed of macrodigits), this word overrides the interpretation specified by {ju'au} (but only for this macrodigit); thus, for example, a Tsohnai number can have each of its macrodigits be interpreted in balanced quinary except one, which the speaker specifies via this word, because they know the value but did not want to convert it to balanced quinary (because it may be too large or hard to do so easily), so they instead expressed it in decimal.

kai'i	experimental cmavo			   	LE      	Property relativizing determiner / unary quantifier constructor. {kai'i} introduces a predicate whose first argument slot becomes filled by the property made by taking the bridi in which this {kai'i} appears and putting {ce'u} into the argument slot in which this {kai'i} argument was located. Put formally, "kai'i brodi cu brodu" = "lo ka ce'u brodu cu brodi". Additionally, a {kai'i} term has a rightward logical scope, like quantifiers and adverbials.	{kai'i} can be used to rephrase quantifiers as predicates, e.g. "ro da poi mlatu cu mabru" = "kai'i kampu be lo mlatu cu mabru"; "so'u remna cu kakne su'o simsa" = "kai'i zilrirci/so'umpu be lo remna cu kakne kai'i nartolkau/su'ompu be lo simsa". Other usage examples: "kai'i se snada be mi mo'u pagre lo rirxe" = "I succeeded to cross the river"; "falgau lo patxu fa kai'i snuti" = "making the pot fall was an accident, was unintentional"; "xunre je cukta fa kai'i se sisku be mi" = "A red book is what I'm searching for"; "kai'i dzaze'a cu pagzu'e" = "the number of participants is increasing".

ka'o'ai	experimental cmavo			   	PA5      	imaginary i (non-comma)	This is literally a unit, a pure number that is treated as a scalar; it is what happens when considering C to be a field over C - ordered pairs/tuples for coordinates no longer make much sense. Thus, this number operates exactly as one might think i would/should operate: as a single number, without components. In certain bases, it can be used a pure digit (which simplifies some potential numeric strings, compared to the usage of {ka'o} therein). See also: {ka'o} (and its commentary on Jbovlaste for the justification for this word), {fai'u}.
ka'o'ei	experimental cmavo			   	PA5      	imaginary i, comma - spherical coordinates: first coordinate gives magnitude (complex modulus/radius) of the number, the second number gives the angle from the positive real axis measured counterclockwise toward the 'positive' imaginary axis (default: in the primary branch/Arg) as measured in some units (which that number should contain; the contextless default will suppose radians); the angle is not normalized.	The number (r, x) = r*e^(i x); this would be denoted by "ry ka'o'ei xy". The angle x is (by default) measured in radians and is not normalized (contains no hidden/inherent multiples of pi); it will canonically be between 0 and tau radians (inclusive on only one side; "tau" here means "{tau'u}"), but it need not be so restricted; x will almost certainly be real. r is necessarily nonnegative and real. r = 0 implies that (r,x) = 0 (as a complex number - id est: complex zero); r being infinite implies that (r,x) is complex infinity (on the Riemann sphere, for example); in either of these situations, x will default to x = 0 if possible - otherwise, to the least value allowed by its domain which is congruent to 0 modulo tau radians.

User beware: usage is tricky. See also: {kau'e}, {kau'i}, {da'au}, {da}.
kau'ai	experimental cmavo			   	KAUhAI      	Microdigit-spanning endianness binary-toggle.	Switches the endianness of the microdigits in all subsequent numeric strings (during their interpretation phase) from big-endian to little-endian or vice-versa; macrodigit endianness is unaffected; it does span across  macrodigits (into their microdigits), until used again or terminated by the end of scope of {li}, etc. (see below). So, for example, in the context of specifying a month of the year and a day of the month (in macrodigit big-endian format: MM-DD), exactly "kau'ai pa re pi'e pa no" is in little-endian mode for exactly the microdigits and means only the first day of the twenty-first month, if it existed, (and not the twelfth day of the tenth month, the tenth day of the twelfth month, the twenty-first day of the first month, or anything else); meanwhile, exactly "kau'ai kau'ai pa re pi'e pa no" is big-endian in its microdigits and means only the tenth day of the twelfth month (and not the twenty-first day of the first month, the twelfth day of the tenth month, the first day of the twenty-first month (if it existed), or anything else). Without prior specification or context, Lojban assumes a big-endian setting (although such language is never explicitly used in the CLL), except for certain brivla (such as {detri}, currently); in such a case or in any case whatsoever other than having previously and still-actively and explicitly specified the little-endian interpretation, including bi-endian or middle-endian etc./vel sim. cases, the first active and explicit usage of this word (called the "original usage" here) switches the interpretation to little-endian; thereafter, each usage will toggle between big-endian (all odd-numbered subsequent occurrences) and then back to little-endian (all even-numbered subsequent occurrences), where the original usage (which switched away from contextless default or non-little-endian interpretation) is counted as the zeroth usage. This function is an involution (at least after the original usage). It terminates with the closing of the scope of {li}, the usage of a brivla or gadri or {du} (or similar) or {boi}, or the overarching specification for the text (iff used therein); it does span across (not terminate with) VUhU and the like. For now, it really should not be used twice within the same numeric string/macrodigit. Notice that exactly "kau'ai pa re ci" means "three hundred twenty-one" because there is only one macrodigit (so, its remaining big-endian, assuming contextless default, is inconsequential), but its microdigits have become little-endian. See also: {kau'au}.
kau'au	experimental cmavo			   	KAUhAI      	Macrodigit-spanning endianness binary-toggle.	Switches the endianness of the macrodigits in all subsequent numeric strings (during their interpretation phase) from big-endian to little-endian or vice-versa; the internal structure (microdigit interpretation) of each macrodigit is not affected. So, for example, in the context of specifying a month of the year and a day of the month, exactly "kau'au pa re pi'e pa no" is in little-endian mode for exactly its macrodigits and means only the twelfth day of the tenth month (and not the twenty-first day of the first month, the tenth day of the twelfth month, the first day of the twenty-first month (if it existed), or anything else); meanwhile, exactly "kau'au kau'au pa re pi'e pa no" is big-endian for exactly its macrodigits and means only the tenth day of the twelfth month (and not the twenty-first day of the first month, the twelfth day of the tenth month, the first day of the twenty-first month (if it existed), or anything else).

This function is an involution (at least after the original usage). It terminates as {kau'ai} does: with the closing of the scope of {li}, the usage of a brivla or gadri or {du} (or the like) or {boi}, or the overarching specification for the text (iff used therein); it does span over (not terminate with) VUhU. For now, it really should not be used within the same numeric string. Notice that exactly "kau'au pa re ci" still means "one hundred twenty-three" because there is only one macrodigit (so, its now being little-endian is inconsequential) and its microdigits are still big-endian, assuming contextless default. See also: {kau'ai}.

Used for octonions, sedenions, etc. Can also be used for R, C, or H. Works like {ka'o} (as a comma) and is isomorphic to it. See also: {ka'o}, {kai'o}, {kei'o}, {koi'o}.
kau'u	experimental cmavo			   	KAUhU      	Predicate to variable-binding binary quantifier. The first slot of the predicate must be a property.	Terminator: {te'u}. Semantically equivalent to {kai'i} but behaving syntactically as a quantifier, and therefore able to bind {da}, for example. If a kau'u-phrase is followed by a selbri or a poi-clause, the referents of the x1 or ke'a slot of those will be passed collectively to the x2 of the kau'u-predicate. A kau'u-phrase followed by a sumti other than a bindable variable ({da}…) will treat this latter as if it was a selbri «me [the sumti] me'u». Usage examples: «kau'u roldza da viska da» = «roldza fa lo ka ce'u viska ri» = «ro da viska da»; «kau'u kampu lo mlatu cu se tuple vo da» = «kampu lo mlatu fa lo ka ce'u se tuple vo da» = «ro lo mlatu cu se tuple vo da».

Terminates with the explicit introduction of a sumti or "{cu}", or the end of the text, only; these markings must be explicit. It applies to that sumti or selbri (whichever comes first). Can be used in order to modify words like "{mi}" adjectivally, but might be able to even apply large structures like whole brivla as seltau to sumti if used properly.

This essentially puts {ke'oi} before every tanru. // This is an experimental cmavo in the truest sense of the word, used to test out "what if" Lojban chose "noun-adjective"  order, which does have several advantages (chief of them being that the selbri-unit that describes the subject is uttered first), despite being unusual for English speakers.

Produces the set of all numbers that are given by some ordered tuple of elements (the nth term of which belongs to the nth set specified, for all n) with the operator acting on them/the tuple (per the rules of that operator). The set produced may include empty terms and/or infinity. Let "@" represent the operator and "x_i" represent a set for all i; then x_1 kei'ai @ x_2 boi x_3 boi x_4 boi \\dots = Set(@(t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4, \\dots): t_i in x_i for all i); the ordered Cartesian product of the operands of 'kei'ai @' must be a subset of the domain set of '@'. If f is unitary and we convert it to a set operator 'kei'ai f' = F, then for any good set A, F(A) = \\operatorname{img}_f (A), which is the image of A under the function/map f.  See also {kei'au} for a similar but different word.
kei'au	experimental cmavo			   	KEIhAU      	mekso operator: finite result set derived from/on set A with/due to operator/function B under ordering of application C	Equivalent to: lo'i li zy du ca'e li pe'o se'au mau'au B zai'ai vei ma'o xy boi ny ve'o boi tau sy boi C ku poi ke'a cmaci xanri zi'e poi ke'a mleca li ci'i zo'u tau sy klesi A. Acts on an operator/function (B) and produces all finite results of that operator being used on any allowable number of elements of the set A without repetition within any given application; the results cannot be used as operands unless they are in A, but they are still in the result set. In order to overcome this limitation, iteration can be used (else, this definition may need to be modified). The result must be defined (and finite, obviously). Application of the operator on nothing (the elements of the empty set) is generically allowed and follows convention (for example, an empty sum may evaluate to 0). Differs from {kei'ai}. Use {mau'au} and {zai'ai} for quoting B. C will be specified explicitly (possibly elsewhere) and/or via {zoi'ai}.
kei'ei	experimental cmavo			   	PA2      	digit/number: hex digit E (decimal 14) [fourteen].	Used as an alternative to {rei}/{xei} due to unique consonant. Useful in crowded situations. Experimental rafsi: -kim-
kei'i	experimental cmavo			   	KEIhI      	non-logical connective/mekso operator - of arity only 1 xor 2: set (absolute) complement, or set exclusion (relative complement). Unary: X_1 ^{C}; binary: X_1 - X_2.	In the definition and in this note, due to parsing constraints, "-" represents set exclusion; this is typically denoted as a backslash elsewhere. Each input must be a set or similar. The definition of the binary case expands to "the set of all elements which are in X_1 but not in X_2". This word and operator has ordered input: 'X_1 kei'i X_2' is not generally equivalent to 'X_2 kei'i X_1'; in other words, the operator is not commutative. If unary (meaning that X_1 is not explicitly specified in a hypothetical expression "X_1 - X_2"), then X_1 is taken to be some universal set O in/of the discourse (of which all other mentioned sets are subsets, at the least); in this case, the word operates as the set (absolute) complement of the explicitly mentioned set here (but not in the definition) designated as X_2 for clarity (id est: the output is O - X_2 = X_2 ^{C}, where "^{C}" denotes the set absolute complement; in other words, it is the set of all elements which may be under consideration such that they are not elements of the explicitly specified set). When binary with both X_1 and X_2 explicitly specified, this word/operator is the set relative complement. Somewhat analogous to logical 'NOT' (just as set intersection is analogous to logical 'AND', and set union is analogous to logical '(AND/)OR'). The preferred description/name in English is "set (theoretic) exclusion". For reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory) .

Marks a "selskiski"/"military-style"/"noun-adjective" tanru, i.e. {tertau} come *before* {seltau}. This differs from {co} in that it does not affect the place structure of the sumti to the right; i.e. in {mi ke'oi broda brode do} (= {mi brode broda do}), both {mi} and {do} are arguments of {broda}. Default grouping is still left: {lo ke'oi ckule nixli cmalu melbi} resolves to {lo ke'oi (((ckule nixli) cmalu) melbi)}, which is equivalent to {lo melbi ke cmalu ke nixli ckule}. {co} does not (re-)reverse the order of tanru-modification; it only changes place structure.

ko'o'e	experimental cmavo			   	KOhA      	Pro-sumti: references a previously mentioned sumti, but which one is not specified.	Like "{zo'e}", but its set of possible referents is restricted to only the set of all aforementioned sumti. This is useful in riddles, jokes, and other circumstances when revealing the exact referent is disadvantageous; also, it can be useful in translations of words like "it", "he", "she", and "they" when the translator is not sure of the original pronouns' referents. Each usage updates (meaning that distinct usages of this word can refer to mutually different sumti and any additional new sumti which appears between them can be a referent of the second but not the first "ko'o'e"). Pragmatically, the probability of sumti x being the intended referent decreases dramatically unless x was rather recently mentioned. See also: "{ri}", "{ko'a}", "{ko'o'au}".

ku'ai	experimental cmavo			   	BAI      	ku'i modal: in contrast to...	Differs from {ku'i} in that it allows for more grammatical structures than UI. In particular, "se ku'ai" indicates that what has just been said is an exception to a general rule that is about to be stated, a syntax impossible with UI and roughly corresponding to the English "A (in contrast to B)" or "A, rather than B". Also corresponds to the dualism between {mu'a} (in UI) and {mu'u} (in BAI). See also: {ku'i}.
ku'ai'i	experimental cmavo			   	GOhA      	empty/vacuous selbri	Accepts arbitrarily many sumti and just acts so as to string them together as a list of nouns (they may of course be connected by cmavo of selma'o (J)A). The cardinality of its terbri is in any particular instance exactly the number of nouns explicitly uttered (no implicit "zo'e"s occur); therefore, ".{i} {zi'o} zi'o ... zi'o ku'ai'i .i", where there are n distinct occurrances of "zi'o" for nonnegative integer n, implies that that usage of "ku'ai'i" had exactly n sumti slots and, no matter what n is, the bridi as a whole is equivalent in meaning to 'actively' uttering silence/nothing; this is particularly true for n = 0. This word can be used for mottos: "loi krati .e lo ka se krali cu ku'ai'i" (= "Rights and Representation(!)"), "lo ka zifre .e lo ka dunli .e lo ka dibype'o cu ku'ai'i" (= "Liberte', E'galite', Fraternite' (!)", a motto of France), etc.

ku'au'i	experimental cmavo			   	COI      	categorizer/hashtag	Differs from {sau'e'u} in that this word denotes the general body of subjects to which the discourse is related by focus. {sau'e'u} denotes the specific manifestation/substantiation of those topics in a given, indicated form. They are closely related, however; arguably, the real difference is the way in which the tagged subject relates to the utterance: does it point out the primary point of the message so that people know about what it is ({sau'e'u}), or does it indicate a general idea or event which has many possible conversations under its umbrella (this word; those specific conversations can be indicated by topicalization)? This is only one meaning of hashtags; other free modifiers can be used for other meanings.

ku'i'a	experimental cmavo			   	PA4      	PA: blank/empty digit	If included in a digit string, the string is interpreted as if it were not present/uttered at all; in subscripts/indices, if it is the only thing mentioned, the subscript/index is deleted as the quantity becomes that which would be denoted by all higher/shallower/previous levels of indexing: t_{()} = t, t_{i_{()}} = t_i. On its own, it means the empty digit; a string of only this digit produces the empty digit string of the given length; once evaluated, any string of only this digit produces the empty number. This word is useful for answering questions or simplifyig notation and otherwise repetitious statements. For example: "li so pi'i papa du li so xo so ju'u dau" ("9*11 = 9?9") may be answered with this word (technically, any string of length at least 1 which consists only of this digit would work). This word, in appropriate contexts, may be a target interpretation of {xo'e} and/or {xo'ei}; explicit restriction so that the intended digit cannot equal this one would clarify.

This word is useful for distinguishing between, for example, differentiating between something that the speaker happens to call "PEMDAS" and the order of operations PEMDAS (which, presumably, could be included in the grammar as a special word that influences mekso interpretation); likewise for a font that happens to be called ".{mekrot}."

Allows specifying which alphabet is assumed when spelling across an entire passage.  Used with {zai} or, e.g. {lo'a} (the etymological inspiration) to make it so that that alphabet is the default.  For example, «zai zbalermorna bu lai'a» would mean that zbalermorna is assumed for all letters.

lai'e	experimental cmavo			   	LAhE      	Named reference. It converts a sumti into another sumti. The converted sumti points to the referent the name of which is the referent of the unconverted sumti.	``lai'e ko'a''=``zo'e noi se cmene ko'a''. {lai'e} is a cmavo of LAhE, and followed by any sumti including ``lo se du'u BRIDI'', ``zo...'', ``lu...li'u'', ``lo'u...le'u'' or ``zoi...'', used with an elidable terminater {lu'u}. For example, ``lai'e lo se du'u ti brife doi la betis'' refers to something the name of which is a text in a language that means ``ti brife doi la betis'', while ``la'e lo se du'u ti brife doi la betis'' refers to the same as ``lo du'u ti brife doi la betis''. The syntax of sumti following {lai'e} is analysed by the parser, while the syntax of strings following {la'ai} or {la'o} is ignored. In the cases that {lai'e} is followed by {lu}, {lo'u} or {zoi}, the referent is the same as that of sumti formed by {la'au}, {la'ai} or {la'o} respectively: ``lai'e lu ti brife doi la betis li'u (lu'u)''=``la'au ti brife doi la betis li'u''; ``lai'e lo'u se ly van beti le'u (lu'u)''=``la'ai se ly van beti le'u''; ``lai'e zoi zoi C'est le vent, Betty zoi (lu'u)''=``la'o zoi C'est le vent, Betty zoi''.

The order {sa'ai} ... {lo'ai} ... {le'ai} is also allowed, and either or both parts can be omitted and thus left up to context.  When both parts are omitted, the word {le'ai} on its own indicates that a mistake was made while leaving all the details up to context. It is also possible to attach SAI to a le'ai construct: le'ai {dai} (or le'ai {da'oi} ko'a) indicates that someone else made a mistake; le'ai {pei} asks whether someone else made a mistake; and {sai}, {ru'e} and {cu'i} can be used to indicate the importance of the substitution. Furthermore, le'ai {nai} can be used to explicitly deny mistakes instead of acknowledging them (compare "sic").

Inverse of {du'au}; however note that this is not single-valued, while {du'au} (provided context) is single-valued.

lu'ei	experimental cmavo			   	LUhEI      	convert a grammatical quotation to a tanru unit; x_1 expresses/says the quoted text for audience x_2 via expressive medium x_3.	The terminator is {li'au}. It is neither grammatical nor logical that a fragment and a sentence are connected by a sentence conjunction like ``.i je'' or ``.i ba bo''. However, such an expression is common among non-Lojban texts. Selma'o {lu'ei} forms a tanru unit, and helps us to translate such an expression without losing logical aspect of Lojban. It is also useful in writing scenarios. See also {li'au}, {lu} and {me}. Example 1: lu'ei ki'u lo nu la'e di'u na se tarti mi'a noi cinfo ku'o lo tamsmi sei spuda li'au .i ba bo la cinfo fau lo nu banli plipe cu cecla vofli pagre lo vacri gi'e snura zvabi'o lo ragve (cited and modified from ``lo se manci te makfa pe la .oz.'' translated by la selpa'i.)

Establish (elsewhere) a universal set/topological space O and equip it with a measure L; then X_1 must be an  element of O, and X_2 must be a subset/subspace of O and will be equipped with/inherit the same measure L (restricted to it) and the appropriate topology. Let Y be the maximal non-discrete subset/subspace of X_2 (in other words, all non-discrete subsets/subspaces of X_2 are subsets/subspaces of Y). The term 'A' in the definition is a nonnegative-valued 'function' which is defined on the category of sets; it produces the proper normalization (by being the reciprocal of the integral of u over O with respect to L iff such is well-defined and finite and positive; otherwise, it is identically 0). The term 'u' in the definition is defined to be the sum of the indicator function (Kronecker delta) for Y (outputting 1 iff X_1 is an element Y, and outputting 0 otherwise) and the Dirac delta of: 1 minus the indicator function for the relative complement of Y in X_2 (id est: X_2 \\\\ Y); it should be noted that all functions mentioned are defined on all of O but have nonzero values according to only the previous description (in particular, u = 0 identically in O \\\\ X_2); the indicator functions directly are functions of the input X_1.

Probably semantically maximally and generally elliptical/generic. Typing can be restricted by (possibly metalinguistic) restriction. See also: {zai'o} (pro-sumti; empty), {gai'o} (pro-bridi; empty), {cei'i} (pro-bridi; universal), {ctaipe}. Proposed by: lai .az. .e lai .krtisfranks.

It should probably not be generalized to include the Levi-Civita symbol or other "sign" functions.

ma'o'e	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mathematical operator: vague/elliptical/general/generic operator	Arity is context-dependent. Properties and structure are context-dependent or vague. See also: {xo'e}, {zi'a'o}. Preferred over {ma'e'o}.
ma'oi	experimental cmavo			   	ZO      	selma'o quote; quotes a word (a cmavo) and uses it to name a selma'o.	The output is the selma'o to which the quoted cmavo belongs (according to the relevant frammar/standards/version); thus any cmavo in the same given selma'o could be used in order to reference that selma'o (not just the canonical cmavo works). Example: "ma'oi coi" is equivalent to COI, as is "ma'oi co'o". For the most part, this will ignore sub-selma'o classes (such as VUhU1 versus VUhU2; both would be treated as simply VUhU). See also: "{ra'oi}".
ma'oi'e	experimental cmavo			   	ZO      	Like "ma'oi" but outputs the officially-designated/canonical sub-selma'o (if any) to which the immediately following and quoted word (cmavo) belongs, otherwise outputting the whole relevant selma'o in fashion equivalent to "ma'oi".	Example: "ma'oi {vu'u}" = VUhU = "ma'oi {ne'o}"; but "ma'oi'e vu'u" = VUhU1 and "ma'oi'e ne'o" = VUhU3, which are mutually distinct and are not equivalent to VUhU itself. See also: "{ma'oi}".

mau'au	experimental cmavo			   	MAUhAU      	mekso: conversion of operator/function to operand	Must be followed by a function (meaning "f", not "f(x)" (which is a number)) or operator (such as "+"). Treats it formally and syntactically as a number so that it can be operated upon, such as by {se'au} or by a functional/operator (technical sense). Terminated by {zai'ai}; the pair essentially act as mathematical quotation marks.  Also works on connectives and {kei'i}.  Expressions may be complicated (such as with SE, NA, NAI, etc. modifying the string); perhaps one may even find a use for quoting relations (such as equality or element-hood) and/or some brivla or other cmavo.  See also: {kei'au}.
mau'e	experimental cmavo			   	MAUhE      	UI conversion start quote; converts grammatical Lojban text to cmavo of selma'o UI	Internal text/utterance must be grammatical and Lojbanic; output is some unspecified emotion relating to/specific to/associated with the referent of quoted text. The construct as a whole operates/behaves as UI. See also: {mau'o}.

moi'u	experimental cmavo			   	MOI      	x_1 is (n)th member of alphabet/set x_2 ordered by rule x_3, where the count begins at x_4.	Technically, if moi_2 is specified as a particular alphabet, then that word is equivalent to this one modulo moi'u_4; however, when no explicit and particular specification is given, "{moi}" can refer to a far larger set of possibilities whereas this word is meant specifically to encode the symbols in a character set/alphabet to numbers. Typically, n will be restricted to nonnegative integers; however, it may occasionally be useful to pretend that there were, for example, a fictitious letter halfway between "a" and "b" called "a.5" so to speak, so numbers which are not nonnegative integers are definitionally possible in principle for n; similarly, for n < x_4 or n > |x_2| + x_4 - 1, the output may be defined in any number of ways (such as by looping or beginning a new alphabet/extending x_2) or may not be defined/throw an error. An alphabet is any set of symbols (including the empty set) and is defined so as to include the terminology adopted in mathematics. Some alphabets may not normally/traditionally be laid out in one-dimensional order (rather, it may fall into multidimensional tables); in such cases, n may be an ordered tuple which indicates a particular symbol in the alphabet. When n = x_4, the output is the first (so to say) letter/element in the alphabet under the relevant ordering x_3. The symbols in the alphabet need not be lerfu and might even represent numbers (this is the distinction between the symbol/digit "4" and the number 4; the former represents but is not the latter).

mu'ai'au	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mathematical/logical/mekso ternary operator: μ (mu) operator: outputs the most extreme extended-natural number that satisfies relationship/predicate A, where extremeness is bounded by B and of a version determined by C; error output is -1	A is a proposition; it will be a function of at least one variable. The output of this function will cause A to evaluate to true if plugged in as the primary (first) argument of A, except in the Error Case that is described later. C can only be -1 or 1; if C = 1, then extremeness here is defined as "least"; if C = -1, then extremeness here is defined as "greatest". If C = 1, then B is an upperbound; if C = -1, then B is a lowerbound. The contextless default value of C is 1. The contextless default value of B is sgn(C)*infinity (countable, in a sense). The output may be equal to B. The output belongs to the set of all positive integers united with the set of 0 and sgn(C)*infinity. Error Case: If no such number exists, the output is -1. Use A in order to restrict outputs from being pathological for your purposes. Example: Let C = 1 and suppose that there exists a number that satisfies A and is one of the following values: 0, a positive integer, (countable) infinity. Then the output of this function (id est: μ(A, B, 1); where "μ" represents the mu operator) is the least such number that is less than or equal to B. Note that in this example, the contextless default value of B is (countable) infinity.

mu'au	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	unary mekso operator: measure of the complement; 1 - x_1.	x_1 is a real number between 0 and 1 (inclusive on both sides). Multiply by 2π radians, or the like, in order to handle angles.
mu'au'oi	experimental cmavo			   	UI      	Discursive: resuming/continuing example - start new example	This word (on its own) implicitly refers to a previously-defined example and then introduces an example which continues the context and all associations of the referenced example. If the format of an utterance is 'GeneralDescription_1 + Example_1 + GeneralDescription_2 + mu'au'oi Example_2', then this word will explicitly return to the context (including assumed conditions) of Example_1 and the following example (Example_2) should be interpreted as a resumption of the former; thus, the structure can be reordered as 'GeneralDescription_1 + GeneralDescription_2 + Example_1 + Example_2' according to logical structure and content, although the actual utterance will more closely tie Example_i to GeneralDescription_i for all i. Subscript this word in order to refer to specific earlier examples (each of which begins with either "{mu'a}" or "{mu'au'oinai}"); if the subscript is n: n>0, then this word counts forward from the beginning of the present text/conversation, finding the nth-uttered example therein; if n < 0, then this word counts back to the nth-most-recent example which was introduced (via the aforementioned means) in the present conversation; if the subscript is implicit (the default case), then n = -1, meaning that the most recent newly-introduced example is being referenced. Even though "{mu'a}" is generally ambiguous as to whether it is introducing a totally fresh example or a continuation of a previous one, for the purposes of the backcounting/referencing by this word, they each shall be treated as fresh examples (each with their own, sequential label/index). This word borrows the label/index of the example which it references; so, "mu'a A1 mu'a B1 mu'au'oi xi ni'u re A2 mu'au'oi (xi ni'u pa) B2" has B2 acting as a continuation of B1, even though the most recent example (new or continued) is A2.

mu'i'u	experimental cmavo			   	PA      	base-dependent digit: representing exactly one half of one more than the maximum possible single-digit number expressible in the relevant number base	Some pathologies are possible. For a non-balanced, fixed, positive, arithmetic base (such as standard binary, decimal, hexadecimal), this is half of the base (respectively: '1', '5', '8') - in other words, this word in this case (and if the base is even) is equivalent to "vei (vei) pano (ju'u ny ve'o) fe'i re ve'o {boi'ai}"; moreover, if the base is odd, then the result (the meaning of this word) is undefined generically at the current moment and is context- or convention-dependent. In measuring time of day, this word can mean six, twelve, thirty, etc., depending on context (and ignoring leap time-units). For the base-dependent digit for the maximum possible single-digit number expressible in the relevant number base, see {vu'ai}.

mu'o'u	experimental cmavo			   	MUhOhU      	Marks an endpoint of a quote/string/expression and specifies that (relative to the original) the quote/string/expression so marked is complete, accurate, and well-portrayed by the quote/string/expression on the relevant side of the excerpt, including wrt all relevant information and when factoring in the content and context of the quotation-external discourse in which said quote/string/expression appears.	Must be adjacent to a quotation marker (including terminator or delimiter) or "{sedu'u}" or similar; it attaches to the/such a marker such that it is external to the scope of the quote/expression produced/contained/terminated by that marker. For example, in "lu mu'o'u lu coi li'u li'u mu'o'u", the first instance of this word attaches to the second "{lu}" (because it is inside the quotation produced by the first "lu") and the second instance of this word attaches to the second instance of "{li'u}"; it cannot appear adjacent to "{coi}" in this example and yet function in application to the expressed quotation markers because it would then be inside all of the available quotations (nested, in this case), although such is allowed as a pure string (because being able to quote an expression such as "He did say "mu'o'u"" is utile). In a quotation (such as a "lu"-"li'u" quotation) with two markers (initiation and termination), even if one of them is implicit: if this word appears before the quote (at its initiation), then it means that there is no relevant and material information preceding the original version of the presented quote which would drastically alter its interpretation (for example: if the original is "not big", then "big" is technically a quote/substring thereof but there is information prior to this substring which materially alters the interpretation, namely "not"; likewise, cutting out the subject of a sentence which is being quoted and then using the quote in a context in which the subject is implied to be someone or something other than the original constitutes a material change in meaning due to incompleteness and this word would specify against that); if the word appears after the quote (at its termination), then it means that there is no relevant and material information following the original version of the presented quote which would drastically alter its interpretation (for example: if the original is "he chose the men and the women" but the presented quote/substring is "he chose the men" (in a context such that sexism is being accused), then there is information following the presented quote/substring which alters the interpretation, namely "and the women"); note that the interpretation-altering information need not immediately precede or follow the presented quote. For singly-marked quotes (such as by "{zo}") it means that the presented quote/string/expression is complete on both ends (including being the complete word / all relevant rafsi in a lujvo). Modifying this word with "-{nai}" indicates that there definitely is a material change in the meaning of the quote due in part to completeness or lack of appropriate context (textual or otherwise). See also: "{rau'o}", "{rau'oi}", "{boi'o'u}" (for a solution to a technical catch with this word).

nei'ai	experimental cmavo			   	NEIhAI      	double-negative toggle: every odd-counted explicit usage makes negation additive; unmentioned or every even-counted explicit usage makes negation multiplicative.	It applies to the entirety of the current bridi and all future ones until toggled again; multiple but separated usages of this word within the same bridi behave as if they were adjacent. "Additive negation" means that multiple negatives just intensify, but do not cancel, one another. For example in English: "I ain't seen nothin'" means that the speaker is very emphatically claiming to have seen nothing of interest. This is the standard operation for negation in Spanish. "Multiplicative negation" means that negatives cancel, but do not intensify, one another (possibly taking a neutral or abstentional state). "I did not see nothing" in this mode means that the speaker did indeed see something. Note that multiplicative double-negatives are not necessarily equivalent to affirmatives in general. "I like cheese" is an affirmative statement and is not equivalent to "I do not dislike cheese", which is a multiplicative double-negative (and which may indicate a reluctant acceptance of cheese or a neutral feeling toward cheese). In this mode, an even number of negatives in a given statement is not negative and an odd number of negatives in a given statement is not positive. This word applies to all negatives in the text, whether they are free words or rafsi. This word also, but less dramatically, applies to affirmations: in additive mode, multiple affirmatives intensify one another ("I am indeed very much so going!" is a strongly emphasized positive statement); in multiplicative mode, they simply reduce to a single affirmation (for like example, "I am going"). This means that care must be taken: In additive mode, an affirmative marker will partially cancel with a negative particle in some way, reducing its intensity and possibly bringing it to a neutral statement ("I am indeed - not - going" is a neutral statement in this mode, similar to "I may be going"; English does not really have the ability to express such things); in multiplicative mode, an affirmative coupled with a negative simply reduces to the negative, possibly strengthened by a factor equivalent to the intensity of the affirmer ("I am indeed not going" is a clear way of saying that the speaker will not go).

no'au'au	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mathematical/mekso binary operator: the zero/identity-element/(primitive (-))constant operator; outputs the identity-element of structure A (contextless default: the additive group of integers) regardless of the input value of B (except blank or ill-defined values)	According to the contextless default, the (contextless default) output will be identically 0. B can be literally anything imaginable (no specific type is required), so long as B is non-empty (not blank) and is well-defined; if these conditions are satisfied, the identity-element of structure A is output; else, this function is undefined. Notice that in Lojban, a blank must be input explicitly; otherwise {xo'o} will fill the argument implicitly. By skipping arguments in this manner (assuming a known default and using implicit elliptical argument-filling features of Lojban), this operator can be reduced to 0-arity. Note that this operator is different from multiplying by 0. See also: {bai'ei}, {ci'o'au}.

noi'a'u	experimental cmavo			   	NOIhAhU      	PA nonrestrictive/incidental relative clause; attaches to a PA number/numeral/digit with the ke'a referring to that PA number/numeral/digit.	It attaches to the last mentioned PA, which can be only a single digit within a number rather than the entire number itself (if it has digit length greater than one in some base). Thus, beware of grouping. Confer: {poi'a'u}, {jau'au}. The attachment of this word to the immediately preceding word can be ovverridden by the usage of {xe'au}, which begins bracketing together an utterance/subexpression that will be considered to be the single and whole referent of the clause introduced by this word, the utterance of which also finishes the bracket. There is a proposal to expand the attachment of this word to any word spoken in a mekso utterance (rather than only members of selma'o PA), including members of selma'o VUhU, etc. See also: {noi'au}.
noi'au	experimental cmavo			   	NOIhAU      	number/interpreted mathematical object non-restrictive clause	It first terminates the immediately preceding expression and immediately forces its interpretation as a mathematical object as far as possible (so an unmodified PA*, BY*, or SYM* constuct (string) is terminated (as by {boi}) and then understood as a number/word; operators are understood as objects as well). Thn it introduces a restrictive relative clause in which {ke'a} refers to the immediately preceding object. This differs from the PA relative clause markers in that it forces the interpretation of the string as much as possible and the resulting meaning/object is the subject. It interprets the maximal immediately preceding string.

Terminated by {ge'u'i}. For example 'do djica tu'a loi ckafi ji noi'i lu .enai li'u ce lu na .e li'u ge'u'i loi tcati' asks 'Do you want: some coffee, some tea - where your answer can be only the former or the latter?'.

pau'ai	experimental cmavo			   	UI      	rhetorical construct marker - genuine/serious/literal assertion/question/command marker	Place after an interrogative word (such as {xu}, {ma}, {mo}, etc.) in order to indicate that a question (and, in particular, that construct) is being presented rhetorically with no actual desire for an answer (except one that plays along with the purpose). Place after an imperative construct (such as {ko}) in order to rhetorically command the audience- such as with the English sentence "Tell me about it", which actually indicates emphatic and personal agreement rather than a command/request for the details to be explicated or elaborated. Various grammatical structures can be marked as rhetorical flourishes this way; in this capacity, the word might (but need not) operate in a way similar to {pe'a} (such as with, maybe, the phrase "for forty days and forty nights" meaning that some event had a long duration and the utterer wishes to reference/bring to mind the Biblical story of Noah's Flood in some way). Of course, whole bridi can be marked by this word. In general, it elevates the understanding of an utterance from literal to something with a purpose or intent and which may not be entirely factual or genuine but, rather, which is being used a tool in the design of a presentation. This word's negative makes it clear that the utterance is to be understood literally or as a genuine, face-value piece of text (although figurative language may still be present- it is only literal in its presentation, so to speak). See also: {si'ai}
pau'a'u	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mekso operator: part of number/projection (one sense); the X2 part of X1	X1 can be a tensor, in which case the operator applies entry-wise; X1 can be a function, in which case the operator applies pointwise. It extracts the part of the number that belongs to the structure X2 united with the singleton 0. X2 = R implies "real part"; X2 = i*R implies "imaginary part"; X2 = R+ implies "positive part"; X2 = R- implies "negatige part". If X1 has no explicit value/projection in/along X2, then the output is 0. If 0 is X1 or X2, then the output is 0. X1 should really be a structure, not just a set.

pau'ei	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mekso operator: power set - produces the set of all subsets of set X_1 that are of (any) size (that is) X_2 [a nonnegative integer or transfinite/infinite number; default: su'o no].	Possibly also could be used as a nonlogical "connective" of sorts. For accessing more than one cardinality in X_2, use modifiers ("less than"/"greater than") or vague numbers; default: "su'o no", which outputs the set of all subsets of X_1; thus, the unary operator is just the standard power set operator.

Used if you don't know the question word for the class you wish to ask about. {fu'e}...{fu'o} can be used to explicitly declare the scope of the question. See {pau}.

If a construct could be interpreted in a technical sense (such as the word "likelihood" in English in the field of statistics) but is not being used in that technical sense, it may be marked for layperson interpretation by this word. See also: {pe'ainai}.
pe'ainai	cmavo-compound			   	UI3c      	technical meaning; marks a construct as jargon/terminology/technical/precise/exact speech/text	Marks how a construct is to be interpreted/understood.  Similar, but not equivalent, to {pe'anai} and {sa'e}. If a construct should/could be interpreted in a technical sense (such as the word "likelihood" in English in the field of statistics) AND is actually being used in that technical sense (rather than in a layperson sense), it may be marked for technical interpretation by this word. See also: {pe'ai}
pe'anai	cmavo-compound			   	UI3c      	literal sense; marks a construct as literal (non-figurative/non-metaphorical/exact) speech/text	"Literally"; one sense of "exactly speaking".  Not to be used as an intensifier (unlike some usages of "literally" in English).
pe'aru'e	cmavo-compound			   	UI3c*      	weak metaphor marker: indicates that there is some broadening of the concept, typically to include objects of types that are unusual for the defined place structure, but which retains most of the semantic of the word as defined.	See {pe'a}, {ru'e}, {do'a}. See the Lojban definitions for {dimnu'e} and {tcimi'e} for examples.
pecai	cmavo-compound			   	GOI*      	restrictive relative phrase marker: permanently / inalienably associated with; it is impossible or near-impossible to break that relation	Proposed as a variation of {po'e} with less semantic-boundary difficulties, while freeing up {po'e} for reassignment in dialects/forks. Most words that the concept of 'inalienable possession' applies to, e.g. {birka}, {mamta}, or even {pendo} in some natlangs, have a convenient {be} place to be used instead with a better-defined meaning. However, this may be used for any relation that is impossible-or-nigh-impossible to break, e.g. the car you worked on and made custom modifications to for years; in a sense, it will still be "your car" even if you sold it. {do'e}{cai} could be a variation to associate a bridi or the subject of the bridi, e.g. 'ti karce do'ecai mi'. See also {pesai}, {pe}

When placed before a logical connective, makes it so that it is evaluated at the very end, so that it is not blocked by abstractions or sub-bridi. For example: "mi viska lo nanmu .i je mi viska lo ninmu" -> "mi viska lo nanmu .e lo ninmu" -> "mi viska lo nanmu pe'ei je ninmu", not "mi viska lo nanmu je ninmu".

pei'a	experimental cmavo			   	CAI      	scalar / attitudinal question: how very...?	Essentially asks for NAI/CAI. For selbri/sumtcita, the full range of NAI/CAI may be asked for; see http://mw.lojban.org/papri/zipcpi:_scalar_modifiers and {pai'e}. For attitudinals, it is limited to {ru'e}/{na'oi}/{sai}/{cai} or combinations thereof (use {pei} to ask for the full range).

pei'e'a	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	at-most-3-ary mekso operator: "integer exponent" for X_1 divided by X_2 in algebraic structure X_3	Produces the maximum integer n such that X_2 ^n | X_1 in/according to the rules of X_3. X_1 and X_2 each must be nonzero and not units. Context or explicit specification elsewhere may make X_3 unnecessary. For natural numbers, the Wolfram Language calls this "IntegerExponent" (if we ignore the arity and the default specifications; but the argument order is preserved). In this case (X_3 = (N, +, *), where "N " denotes the set of all natural numbers (positive integers)), this function can be usefully restricted to f:(N Exclude Set(1)) Union P -> N Union Set(0), (r,p) -> max( Set(n in N Union Set(0): p^n divides r in N)), where "P" denotes the set of primes in the unique factorization domain of integers.

pei'o	experimental cmavo			   	UI4      	attitudinal category question: what is the category (UI4) of attitudinal?	Specifically asks about the UI4-category, either when attached to attitudinals or used alone.

Of course, any relevant -nai or -cu'i of the category must be included in the answer.

Legal ownership is a possible relation; it could also mean, say, the chair assigned to you in an office, which will remain 'your' chair until reassigned, where mere {pe} could just mean the one you're sitting on. {do'e}{sai} could be a variation to associate a bridi or the subject of the bridi, e.g. 'ti stizu do'esai mi'.

pi'au'e	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mekso ternary operator: extract digit from number; X_2nd macrodigit/term of number/tuple X_1 when X_1 is expressed in base/basis X_3.	X_2 defaults to 0; it must always be an integer. For the purposes of this description, suppose temporarily that the base is decimal/ten; this is for simplicity - statements generalize to other bases. The zeroth digit (X_2 = 0) is the singles digit; the first digit (X_2 = 1) is the tens digit; the nth digit (for any integer n) is the digit which represents the multiple of 10^{n}; the positive-last (X_2 = {ma'uro}) digit is the most significant digit/figure in a finite number expressed in decimal; the negative-first (X_2 = -1) is the one-tenths digit; the negative-last digit for a terminating expansion in decimal is the least significant digit/figure of the number when expressed in decimal. Only macrodigits are extracted; so, in Roman numeral notation, decimal 120 = CXX, and the second (or positive-last) digit is C (which equals 100). X_1 may be expressed in any base but X_3 forces a conversion to its own base for the purposes of this extraction; X_1, X_2, X_3, and the result of the extraction may all be expressed in any base (independent of one another) and the default is assumed to be default of the cultural context for the math (according to the CLL, this is usually decimal), explicitly differing from this base requires {ju'u} or similar (which is allowed). The result/output of this function is a digit (thus, it concatenates with other PA automatically) and must filter through the interpretation rules in order to be considered a number; unless it explicitly expressed otherwise, it is assumed to be in the base of whatever digit-string it occurs in or, failing this/being alone, the base used in the cultural context of the text - it is not necessarily expressed in base-X_3.

pi'ei	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mathematical/mekso binary operator: vector or function inner product over a field; the inner product of A and B over field C	The field is usually defined or implicitly clear from context. May be generalized to higher tensors over fields and which have many (or less) entries; in this case, it is tensor multiplication followed by contraction.
pi'ei'au	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mathematical ternary operator: not-greater-prime-counting function	Outputs the number of prime numbers that are less than or equal to the input value a according to ordering rules b in ring c; contextless default for c is the standard/typical ring of integers (Z,+,*); contextless default for b is the standard typical ordering of the ring, which is the 'normal' absolute value (signless difference/distance with/from 0) for the standard ring (Z,+,*); thus, it will usually operate as an unary operator. Usually denoted "π(n)" in the literature.
pi'ei'oi	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mathematical ternary operator: prime-generating function	The a-th prime according to ordering rules b in ring c; contextless default for c is the standard/typical ring of integers (Z,+,*); contextless default for b is the standard typical ordering of the ring, which is the 'normal' absolute value (signless difference/distance with/from 0) for the standard ring (Z,+,*); thus, it will usually operate as an unary operator. The function must be defined over the set of strictly positive integers (or, more generally, ordinals) in/for the first operand; generalizations may be possible. Ignores units and 0. It begins counting at 1 in/for the first operand; under contextless default conditions, the outputs increase strictly monotonically with respect to increase in the first input [a], starting with the least prime in (Z,+,*), namely p_1 = 2. Usually denoted "p_i" or "Prime" in the literature.

Has/of the full measure but is not literally all of the relevant superset (this word is distinct from and does not include the possibility of "{piro}"); the complementary subset is null but non-empty. In the context of probability, the result is not absolutely and perfectly certain in theory; alternative outcomes are technically possible. See also: "{soi'ai}", {pisu'osoi'ai}".

Having zero measure (not "no measure", since the measure does exist). This word does not contain "{pino}" in its potential reference; use "{pisu'esoi'au}" for that. In the context of probability theory, the relevant event is possible, just with probability 0. The relevant set is null but non-empty. See also: "{soi'au}".

Often, when people say "100%", they mean "pi ro"; however, "{pisoi'ai}" is also possible, but is mutually exclusive with the previous possibility (in the same way that "{re}" cannot mean "{su'o} re"). This cmavo string covers both cases and, so, is basically equivalent to "piro jonai pisoi'ai". See also: "{soi'ai}", "{piro}", "{pa}", "{pisu'esoi'au}".

See also {noi'a}, {poi'o'a}, {noi'o'a}, {soi'a}, {soi}.
poi'a'u	experimental cmavo			   	NOIhAhU      	PA restrictive relative clause; attaches to a PA number/numeral/digit with the ke'a referring to that PA number/numeral/digit.	It attaches to the last mentioned PA, which can be only a single digit within a number rather than the entire number itself (if it has digit length greater than one in some base). Thus, beware of grouping. Confer: {noi'a'u}, {jau'au}. The attachment of this word to the immediately preceding word can be ovverridden by the usage of {xe'au}, which begins bracketing together an utterance/subexpression that will be considered to be the single and whole referent of the clause introduced by this word, the utterance of which also finishes the bracket. There is a proposal to expand the attachment of this word to any word spoken in a mekso utterance (rather than only members of selma'o PA), including members of selma'o VUhU, etc. See also: {poi'au}.
poi'au	experimental cmavo			   	NOIhAU      	number/interpreted mathematical object restrictive clause	It first terminates the immediately preceding expression and immediately forces its interpretation as a mathematical object as far as possible (so an unmodified PA*, BY*, or SYM* constuct (string) is terminated (as by {boi}) and then understood as a number/word; operators are understood as objects as well). Thn it introduces a restrictive relative clause in which {ke'a} refers to the immediately preceding object. This differs from the PA relative clause markers in that it forces the interpretation of the string as much as possible and the resulting meaning/object is the subject. It interprets the maximal immediately preceding string.

The outer bridi is claimed to occur together with the event of the first place of that bridi satisfying the converted selbri. {broda poi'o'a brode} means {broda fau lo nu vo'a brode}.	Terminator {fe'u}. See also {poi'a}, {noi'a}, {noi'o'a}, {soi'a}, {soi}.
po'i'oi	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mekso at-most-3-ary operator: convert to polynomial; X_1 (ordered list of algebraic structure (probably field) elements) forms the (ordered list of) coefficients of a polynomial/Laurent-like series with respect to indeterminate X_2 under ordering rule X_3 (default for finite list: the first entry is the coefficient of the highest-degree term and each subsequent entry is the next lesser-degree coefficient via counting by ones and wherein the last entry is the constant term)	In English, there is no good way to distinguish between x^2 + 2x as a function and as a number; typical notation would demand that it is a number but abuse must be adopted since no easy alternative exists for its expression as a function (such as when it is being defined; mapping notation is one of the best options, but is cumbersome). Lojban now allows for such functionality: just apply this word to the ordered list (1,2,0) and do not fill the second terbri (X_2: the indeterminate). This word can also be viewed as creating an object in a ring. Termination of the list is extremely important; under normal interpretations, list entries can themselves have operations applied internally; moreover, multiple indetermimates can be introduced by careful application of this word to a list wherein each entry is itself treated as a polynomial. The last entry in X_1 must be 'constant' term (when understood as a function), so care must be taken to explicitly mention an appropriate number of zeroes. See also: {cpolinomi'a}.

ra'i'e	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	ternary mekso/mathematical operator: radical; for input (x,y,z), it outputs the largest y-th-power-free product of prime divisors of x in structure (ring) z.	Contextless defaults: z is usually the standard ring of integers (with primes being the standard set of prime numbers; note that this excludes 0, 1, and all negative numbers from the set of primes); y = 2.
rai'i	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mekso (2 or 3)-ary operator: maximum/minimum/extreme element; ordered list of extreme elements of the set underlying ordered set/structure X_1 in direction X_2 of list length X_3 (default: 1)	X_1 must be an ordered set (or an ordered structure); extremeness is measured with respect to the order which endows the underlying set; the output is a list of elements of the underlying set. X_2 accepts only -1 (li {ni'upa}) or +1 (li {ma'upa}); if the input to X_2 is -1, then the type of extreme(ness) is lessness, so minimal elements are listed (starting from the least element in the underlying set according to its order); if the input to X_2 is +1, then the type of extreme(ness) is greatness, so maximal elements are listed (starting from the greatest element in the underlying set according to the order which endows it); not even li {ni'u} nor li {ma'u} on their own are accepted in X_2.  All input for X_3 must be a nonnegative and finite integer, {ro}, or countable infinity ({ci'ino}); nontrivial input for X_3 must is a positive, finite natural number which is less than or equal to the cardinality of the set underlying X_1; submit "{ro}" for X_3 in order to reproduce the underlying set as an ordered list (according to the order endowing the set) only if the underlying set is countable (finite or infinite) and discrete (has only isolated points); submit 0 for X_3 in order to return the empty list; submit {ci'ino} in order to do the same as {ro}, but only if the set is countably infinite and is discrete (has only isolated points). If the set does not attain its supremum (if X_2 = +1) or infimum (if X_2 = -1), then the list is empty. Provided that the list is well-defined and nonempty, then the input of X_3 can be augmented by +1 only if any interval around the last element of the list produced with the previous value of X_3 which extends in the (-X_2)-direction intersected with the set underlying X_1 is either empty or has an (X_2)-determined-extreme element which is isolated and there exists at least one nonempty interval. If the set underlying X_1 is unbounded in the (X_2)-determined direction, then the first extreme element is X_2 * \\infty. This operator produces the first X_3 most X_2-type-extreme elements of X_1 in order starting from the very most extreme of that type. The type of the output is a list, not a number; its elements must be extracted in order to be treated as numbers; this is true even if the length of the list is 1. This function can be defined iteratively: Let ext be this function, denote set difference by "Exclude", denote set union by "Union", ith entry extraction from a list list by "list|_i" where the list starts at the first (i=1) entry list|_1, and set builder notation by Set (where the first input lists the dummy values and possibly their domain, and the second input (if present) contains an exhaustive list of the conditions restricting the dummy values); an ordered structure is denoted by "(A, <)", where A is the underlying set of the structure and '<' is the order which endows the structure. When it is well-defined (and the inputs, excluding m are fixed by context), denote z_{m} = -i * ext((A,<),i,n)|_{m}. Then ext((A,<),i,n) equals a list of length n wherein each entry is an element of A and if n>1, then for any natural number m<n, the following is true: z_{m} < z_{m+1}; and, moreover, there exists no element y in A such that z_{m} < -i*y < z_{m+1}. Then, if it is well-defined, z_{m+1} = ext((A Exclude (Set(z_1) Union ... Union Set(z_{m})),<),i,1).

The original text may be Lojbanic though, in which case "{rau'onai}" would suggest confidence that the quote/wording is exactly as originally expressed (modulo changes such as via "{lo'ai}" etc., vel sim.), whereas "rau'o" would indicate slight rewording (due to change in grammatical or external context, loss of memory accuracy, etc.) which does not affect the basic features of the text/utterance (such as meaning; possibly including things such as particular word choices or poetic qualities). Segment a text into multiple strings and modify those strings via this word individually and then reconcatenate them if you wish to indicate varying degrees of textual fidelity which do not apply overall/generally or to emphasize or specifically mark out particular segments as having a certain fidelity quality. A mild reworking of the exact wording would be marked by "{cu'i}" vel sim., depending on subjective or objective degree of change. See also "{ra'o}", "{sa'a}"/"{to'i}", "{mu'o'u}", "{lo'u}", "{rau'oi}".
rau'oi	experimental cmavo			   	RAUhO      	quote marker: indicates that the quotation being marked has experienced exactly no change in meaning/has the original meaning and is the same in all important qualities - approximately the same meaning/having generally the same idea or effect or message - substantially changes in meaning or some important quality	Such as in a word-for-word translation. The words may change, but so long as the exact same message (in every way, including connotation, formality, style of presentation, etc.) is maintained, then this word may be applied (in addition to "{rau'o}"); obviously, this works best when exactly quoting an utterance in the same language with extremely high confidence (such as after a recording). Use attitudinal intensity modifiers/negators in order to achieve the other valences. Does not imply completeness of the quote or, necessarily (although practically), maintenance of the original quotation's language; see "{mu'o'u}" and "{rau'o}" for these respectively.

re'ai'e	experimental cmavo			   	REhAIhE      	free conversion	Must be followed immediately by an ordered tuple (even if it is empty or 1-entry) of natural numbers which is immediately preceded by {li}; immediately after this tuple (which must be terminated), must be a brivla with at least as many terbri as the maximum of the length of the tuple (the number of entries which it possesses) and the greatest entry. The output of this entire construct is a selbri. The nth entry of the tuple, which is the natural number a_n, is the label number of the terbri in the official definition of the selbri which is the nth terbri in the selbri which is produced as a result of this word. So, for example, the tuple (3, 2, 4, 1) means that the first terbri of the new selbri is the third terbri of the selbri in this construct, the second terbri of the new selbri is the second terbri of the selbri in this construct (no change there), third terbri of the new selbri is the fourth terbri of the selbri in this construct, and fourth terbri of the new selbri is the first terbri of the selbri in this construct. This word might be equivalent to certain {se} {xi} constructs, but provides an alternative for those who might dislike them.

sai'ei	experimental cmavo			   	MAI      	turns PA into CAI; intensity attitude modifier expressed by a mekso.	Used to provide a numerical description of the value on an axis where the attitude intensity of the preceding UI word lies. 1 is taken as the default. For example, {na'oi} = "pa sai'ei", {sai} = "so'o sai'ei", {cai} = "so'i sai'ei", {cu'i} = "no sai'ei", {nai} = "ni'u pa sai'ei". Often the word preceding {sai'ei} will be a subjective number rather than an objective one, or else a number that has more significance than just a raw value: {no}, {ni'u} {pa}, and {ci'i} are examples. In particular, "ci'i sai'ei" ("to an infinite extent") can now be expressed. Also "xo sai'ei" (how strongly?), "xo'e sai'ei" (to some unspecified extent), "tu'o sai'ei" (there isn't really a degree of strength) and other pseudonumbers in PA can be used to create unique and very Lojbanic descriptions.

sau'e'u	experimental cmavo			   	COI      	topicalizer (sumtcita/discursive; somewhat meta): the following discourse is about/relates to/has topic/concerns 	This word is good for the subject line in an email or post; in a conversation with multiple topics (and possibly multiple people responding simultaneously with multiple paragraphs for each topic), it can be used as an organizational tool. It is used to put the audience's mind in the proper/correct thought frame (mindset). It does not really change the meaning of the bridi, but it does indicate to what its content semantically pertains or relates. It can be used as a reminder; for example, "Remember when you told me to go to the store? What did you want me to buy?" -> "Concerning the event of my going to the store, what did you want me to buy?" -> "sau'e'u lonu mi klama lo zarci keiku do djica lonu vecnu ma mi". It is not as attached to the bridi as {sera'a}; this is more discursive and somewhat more meta. The specified topic may endure until the end of the discourse, or the paragraph, or the bridi; it is explicitly cancelled/negated by "{sau'e'unai}" followed by a pointer to whichever part of the topic is being concluded in thought and discourse; it is taken to be the case that the previous topic is concluded whensoever a new one (even what could be considered a subtopic) is introduced. If Eulojban (more specifically, the diphthong/digraph "eu") is ever accepted (in Lojban) as valid, .krtisfranks. would prefer that this word's meaning get directly transferred to and preserved in "{sau'eu}", with this word unassigned; likewise for "{sau'eunai}".

sei'au	experimental cmavo			   	SEIhAU      	terbri editor: passes the terbri value through the quoted function so that the sumti that fills it really is filling the output of the function	Terminated by itself ({sei'au}); explicit termination is always required; the sumti after it must be explicit (even if elliptical, such as with explicit use of {zo'e}). Inside the module formed by the "sei'au" brackets, at most three sumti (where this counting contracts connected sumti into one) can be specified. The first one is a {mau'au}-{zai'ai} quoted function (which is taken to be the operand of this word); it must be preceded (not necessarily immediately) by {li}; let f be this function. The second and third sumti each are a nonnegative integer (preceded by {li}); call them n and m respectively; n defaults to 1 and m defaults to the next (thus-far unfilled) terbri number for/of the current selbri unless these specifications are overridden by zmico; if the relevant selbri has no terbri following this word, then this default value of m causes this word to have no effect. The mth terbri of the selbri to which this construct applies will be passed through f before being filled by any sumti (including {zo'e}, explicit or implicit; terbri numbers start counting at 1 and increase by 1 with each new occurrence) for the next n occurrences of the aforementioned selbri in the discourse (with n = 1 counting the current occurrence; aside: a non-default value of m can thus affect the interpretation of an already-filled terbri of the currently open selbri in an afterthought manner); this counting is only done forward in the discourse/time, including the current selbri, never back through it. Thus, n = 0 effectively neutralizes this word, n being infinite causes the effect to be permanent. f being {zi'a'o} returns the terbri in question to its default value/understanding (according to zmico). It is important to realize that this word does not affect the mth terbri of all selbri, just of the one currently open when this word is utterred (no matter where it is positioned/nested in future costructs). If this word is in conflict with another usage of this word over the same terbri, follow the specification applied by the most recent still active occurrence of this construct; this construct is considered to be active for this purpose until its-n occurrences of the appropriate terbri are uttered; thus if the earlier-n is greater than the later-n, the later effect takes precedent until it is disactivated, after which point the earlier effect resumes. Define n and  m (and f) outside of the module created by brackets of this word if you wish to reuse them; for the sake of future referencing the value specified within the module, n gets reduced/decremented by 1 at each occurrence of the appropriate terbri until it reaches the value 0 (at which value it remains forever after); if n is a series of connected numbers, this decrementation is applied to each connectand in turn. Use {pi'u} (possibly subscripted) in order to simplify utterances. Especially helpful if f is non-injective. The affected terbri must be referenced by {ce'u} as an operand of f wheresoever it is desired; this reference must be explicit.  Let 'broda' be the currentry open selbri; then this word replaces broda_m with f(broda_m) in the definition of 'broda' for the next n occurrences of the terbri. For example, if f were {cu'a}, then any sumti which fills broda_m will be understood to be doing so in absolute value.  See also: {de'ai}.

Can be useful for when one does not quite remember or care about the exact definition of a brivla, including in sumti; can also be useful when the conversion is particularly complicated, when a desired terbri has a large index, or when multiple conversions are true; it is an allowed, if unhelpful, response to {se'u'o}.
se'oi'oi	experimental cmavo			   	SEhOIhOI      	Conversion: Switch n and x_1 in MOI (or MOI*) cmavo so that the submitted value (previous x_1) outputs the number(s) (previous n) associated with it.	Must be immediately followed by MOI(*) vel sim. Output is a multiset, being the pre-image of the submitted value (previous x_1) under the MOI cmavo, when all other sumti are submitted to the MOI cmavo as before; the set will normally be a singleton or the empty set; the fact that the output is a multiset does mean that a particular element must be drawn from it if the whole multiset, as a single entity, is not to be treated. SE conversion could theoretically be used on the MOI first, but .krtis. is not sure what the utility of that would be. See "{moi}", "{se}".

se'u'o	experimental cmavo			   	SE      	selbri conversion question	Asks for the SE word that is intended (or at least makes the sentence true). Subscript a set of numbers that represent the order of terbri in question; the subscripted set can be a set of ordered or unordered tuples, specifying exactly which terbri may be exchanged. 'la .ralf. se'u'o xi li re ce li ci pi'u li re cebo li ci klama by boi cy' = 'Did Ralph come to B from C or to C from B?' (notably, 'Did B come to Ralph from C?' is not a possible option for answering the question). An answer is a SE string that is allowed by the selbri and by the subscripts; continuing the example, if the response is 'Ralph went to C from B', one would respond with '.i {setese}'.  Any SE word works for the general question possibility (which is the unrestricted/non-subscripted case). Essentially 'se'u'o xi sy' is equivalent to 'se xi li xo poi ke'a cmima sy' (where '{te}' is basically understood as ' se xi li jo'i pa boi ci te'u ', etc.), but the answer can be a complicated ordered sequence/string of SE words; this word complements specifically {fi'a} in the typical/same way that SE complements FA. Typically, leaving the subscripted set vague or not completely free of every possible semantic or syntactic pathology is perfectly fine; syntax and practicality will typically restrict it enough for reasonable responses to be made. See also: {re'au'e} (which alone would be used in answering that 'Ralph goes to B from C' in the previous question).

si'ai	experimental cmavo			   	UI      	marks a construct as being a reference/allusion - explicit marker of divorce/isolation of a construct from any external allusions that may come to mind	The subject of the allusion may be general cultural knowledge or to another utterance, especially in the same work/text/speech. There is an intent by the utterer to bring to mind somewhat external pieces of knowledge that are somewhat similar or relate to the marked construct in some (unspecified) manner. The audience is expected to understand but need not actually be able to do so. The subject of the allusion can be included via, for example, a {to}-{toi} construct. The allusion can be an exact or nearly-exact quotation or can be more loose/vague; the intensity of the marker will give some indication to this. The negation of this word marks a construct as standing on its own, independent and isolated/divorced from any potential allusions that may inadvertently arise. This is a rhetorical device.

si'ei	experimental cmavo			   	PA3      	numeric suffix: indicates that the number refers to portionality instead of cardinality	e.g. {fi'u} {re} {si'ei} {lo} {vo} {prenu} = "half of the four people (i.e. two of the four)"; contrast with {fi'u} {re} {lo} {vo} {prenu} = "a half person of the four people (!)". {fi'u} {re} {si'ei} {lo} {vo} {prenu} is equivalent to {lo} {fi'u} {re} {si'e} {be} {lo} {vo} {prenu}. Other possible uses: {ci} {fi'u} {vo} {si'ei} {roi} = "three quarters of the time", {pi} {mu} {si'ei} {moi} = the middlemost member of a sequence. See {si'e}

si'i'ai	experimental cmavo			   	PA      	digit/number: a finite/bounded number, finitely many.	The absolute value/magnitude/norm of this number is strictly less than positive infinity; this condition is the defining criterion. It need not be single-digit represented in the current base. It need not be real, positive, integral/whole, etc. In isolation, it might be equivalent to "ci'i nai" in some experimental conventions; when concatenated, it may behave somewhat differently in that it is more or less equivalent to {xo'ei} but unrestricted by the base and must not refer to {ci'i}. If {ni'u} or {ma'u} precedes it, then the referent of this word specifically is taken to be nonnegative if it is real - thus {ni'usi'i'ai} would be a finite/bounded but negative real number and {ma'usi'i'ai} would be a finite/bounded but positive real number, each possibly also including 0 as a possibility, under such assumptions. This is used with {ni'u} (resp. {ma'u}) in order to explicitly specify a finite and nonpositive (resp. nonnegative) number (if it is real); on their own, {ni'u} or {ma'u} can refer to infinities as well. {xo'ei} can refer to this meaning, but it is equipped with additional restrictions, since {xo'e} and {xo'ei} know their context; {xo'e} is a bit more general in that it can refer to infinite numbers too.
si'i'ei	experimental cmavo			   	SIhIhEI      	story time toggle.	"Story time interpretation" is as is described in CLL v1.1 Chapter 10 Section 14 ( http://lojban.org/publications/cll/cll_v1.1_xhtml-section-chunks/section-story-time.html ). The first explicit usage of this word causes the interpretation of the following text/narrative/conversation/utterance to be interpreted as experiencing story time; the toggle status is explicitly 'on'. This holds even if story time interpretation had been implicitly used or required prior to such point within the same text/narrative/conversation/utterance. Thereafter, every subsequent explicit usage of this word alters the toggle status for story time interpretation between explicit application ('on') and explicit not-application ('off'), and nothing else, so that the toggle status immediately after such a usage differs from the toggle status immediately prior to such usage; consequently, within a given text/narrative/conversation/utterance, all odd-numbered explicit usages of this word cause story time interpretation to apply (the resultant toggle status is explicitly 'on') and all even-numbered explicit usages of this word cause story time interpretation to no longer apply (the resultant toggle status is explicitly 'off'). See also: "{ki}".
si'i'oi	experimental cmavo			   	SIhIhOI      	Marks discontinuity in story time.	When story time is either implicitly or explicitly active, this word explicitly marks a jump discontinuity between the foregoing scene/section/chapter and the current/immediately-following one; but story time is flowing piecewise continuously on either side of it. For example, a flashback or a scene break so that an already-seen (and thus now-past) event is being re-experienced from another perspective could be so marked. A sharp/notable jump futureward (often denoted by a chapter break or a tildebrand) could also be so marked. Theoretically, a jump to another location or perspective but at the same (or imemdiately-following) instant could also be marked in this way. Typically, narrations will not say the direction of jump because the slight confusion or lack of that information is used for stylistic or dramatic effect; however, such could presumably be denoted with tense markers or subscripts. See also: "{si'i'ei}".

Used when a speaker decides to erase a word, phrase, or sentence, but then decides that on second thought they want to retain it. More useful with SA or SU than SI, but could also be used with SI when it has erased a particularly long word. Necessarily, a parser must carry out SIhOI erasure before SI, SA and SU erasure. More meta levels of SI are not needed, since SI and SIhOI can just alternate. "ti broda si si'oi si brode" = "ti brode". See also: {si}, {sa}, {su}, {si'au'i}.

Important point: This word further assumes that the complementary set is non-empty, meaning that this word cannot mean "literally and affirmatively all/every/everywhere" (which is "ro"); this is similar to how "{re}" is not the same as "{su'o} re"; in order to include both possibilities, use "{su'osoi'ai}". Additionally, this word can be used as a quantifier. See also: "{soi'au}", "{pisoi'ai}".
soi'au	experimental cmavo			   	PA      	almost none/almost no/almost nowhere (technical sense): the subset of satisfactory such things is null but non-empty.	This word does not potentially include "{no}"; there exists at least one element of the universal set which is satisfactory; for inclusion of either option, use "{su'esoi'au}"; this extra requirement is analogous to "{ci}" not including "{re}" or "{su'e} ci" and is directly similar to the distinction between "soi'au" and "{su'osoi'ai}". This word can be used as a quantifier. See also: "{soi'ai}", "{pisoi'au}".

Subscript {fa'u} when multiple such operators (including "positive or negative" and others) are in use but are applied independently. This word is more useful and more general in mathematics than {su'ijavu'u} is, but is perhaps/arguably less general(ly useful) in Lojban, syntactically speaking, since not all statements have multiple occurrences of {fa'u} that may be linked.

This word is general but could easily be replaced by {su'ijonaivu'u} when the two options are not equivalent (usually when none of the operands are 0). Not preferred in complicated expressions wherein order of operations is important: see {su'ifa'uvu'u} or {su'ifa'u'aivu'u}.
su'i'o	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mekso unary or binary operator: ordered inputs (n, b) where n and b are nonnegative integers and b > 1; output is the ultimate digital root of n in base-b.	Often denoted "dr". b defaults to whichever base in which n was expressed; output is in base-b. Thus, if we assume the cultural default of the traditional decimal system, then n will be expressed in this base and b will be defaulted to b = 2*5 and thus omitted (yielding an unary operator here). For a fixed base b and n = eval("n_1n_2...n_m") where "n_i" is a digit in base b for each i, if n<b then dr(n, b) = n else dr(n, b) = dr(n_1 + n_ 2 +...+ n_m, b). This might be extended to values of n which are not nonnegative integers via various means such as the piecewise function based on modular arithmetic (although this breaks the intuition that dr(9.9) = 9, for example); it may also be extended to exotic bases. This is repeated self-application (left-composition) "{su'i'e}" until a fixed point (single-digit numeric string) is output.

su'o'o	experimental cmavo			   	PA      	digit/number: strictly greater (more) than 0 but strictly less than all (jbo.: "ro").	Equivalent to the word "some" in "at least some (of) kids are cute" (this would be translated with "su'o su'o'o"; "some" here on its own means "at least 1 but not all" and the "at least" modifies it to be "at least 1 but not necessarily all").

tai'e'i	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU?      	mekso unary operator: basic Schlafli symbol composer (defined only on ordered lists)	Given an ordered (typically finite) list (which is a single object) of zero or more (probably nonnegative) rational numbers, L = (X_1, X_2, ..., X_n). This word composes them in order into a Schlafli symbol S(L) with these entries exactly and without any entries that do not appear in the list so as to produce an (n-1)-dimensional regular polytope. For example: L = () implies that S(L) = S(()) is a line segment. Where L = (6), S(L) = S((6)) is a regular convex hexagon; generally, for integer X_1 > 2, S((X_1)) is a proper convex regular (X_1)-gon. S((X_1, X_2) is a proper convex regular polyhedron with polygonal faces being all of form S((X_1)) such that they are arranged with X_2 touching at each vertex of the polyhedron. Star polytopes and tessellations are supported. More general notation such as Schlafli symbols prefixed by a letter/acted upon by a function, which are affixed with/multiplied by a number or other symbols, which contain "|", etc. are not presently supported in this definition; only the most basic/classic Schlafli symbols (those composed of a single pair of curly braces containing rational numbers separated only by commas, and nothing else) are presently supported. Certain operators (such as "half", "alter", etc., as well as Cartesian product, "add"/"plus", and "join", and affixation of other numbers or symbols) have somewhat special definitions on Schlafli symbols; they are presently not supported in Lojban (but this will hopefully soon change). Not all ordered lists will produce good output. See also: {tarmrclefli}

This is how one says "block O", where "O" is the symbol (approximately a circle, in this case) modified by a font face which is blocky; a "C"-shaped thing is given by "{ro'au'o} {cy} tai'u" or, equivalently in most font faces, "{ru'o} {sy} tai'u".

ta'u'i	experimental cmavo			   	TAhUhI      	Copy and paste the overall seltau of immediately preceding sumti at this location.	This is a rather basic and crude/clunky form of seltau distribution/duplication. Identifies the most recent sumti (subject to the standard rules of back-counting); in that sumti, it identifies the overall/outermost/last tertau of the whole construct and naively copies all of its seltau, in the order and manner presented, in their entirety; then it pastes them here (where this word was uttered), exactly as they were, as seltau again - this words stands in for that seltau construct and can be replaced by (only) exactly it, in all respects. This means that the seltau may compound with any other seltau present in the current construct; in any case (regardless of the presence of other seltau), the exact semantic interpretation of the referrent/copy-pasted seltau or the tanru construct as a whole may vary from that from which the relevant seltau were copied. Subscript with an integer in order to specify how many sumti to count backward through: "0" indicates the present sumti, "+1" indicates the immediately previous sumti (this is the default or non-subscripted meaning), "n" (for positive integer n) indicates the nth last sumti, "-1" means the next sumti, etc. Since this word acts as a seltau, it will be picked up in an immediately subsequent usage of the same word if the first occurrence is in a sumti. This word must always be followed by an explicit tertau to which it applies. This word need not be used in only sumti. It copies every element of the relevant seltau; it cannot select any proper subsequence thereof. "{si}" deletes this word and, thus, at once all of the would-be pasted words forming the relevant seltau. In "{lo} {cmalu} {je} {cadzu} {klama} {mlatu}", it copies and pastes only and exactly "cmalu je cadzu klama". Couples with JA as any brivla would when the latter is acting as a seltau. See also: {ta'u'u}.

ta'u'u	experimental cmavo			   	TAhUhI      	Copy and paste the overall tertau of immediately preceding sumti at this location.	Operates just like "{ta'u'i}", except it copies and pastes only the overall/last tertau of the whole construct. It is, basically, like "{ri}", except it may not be a sumti (the ('pasted') result of this word could be used in a tanru or as a selbri) and it only copies the heart/nucleus/head (tertau) of the sumti (rather than the whole thing). In "lo cmalu je cadzu klama mlatu", it copies and pastes only and exactly "mlatu".
tau'u	experimental cmavo			   	PA5      	digit/number: tau (approximately 6.2831...). The constant defined by the ratio of the circumference to the radius of all circles.

te'au	experimental cmavo			      		iterated Cartesian product with self: A × A × ... × A, n times.	Probably belongs to selma'o VUhU but, since it is iterated JOI, there is the case for that. First argument A is a set or similar object; second argument n is a nonnegative integer; the result is the cross-product of A with itself n times. Used as a shortcut for longer, arguably more preferable, constructions so that one can more closely say "R three" and mean R^3. Emphatically not equivalent to exponentiation; it only works on sets and similar objects. See also: {te'a}, {pi'u}, {se'au}.
te'au'u	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mekso ternary operator: Knuth up-arrow notation: a \\uparrow \\dots \\uparrow b of order/with c-2 arrows ("\\uparrow") initially, evaluated from right to left; the cth hyperoperator on a by b.	c must be a nonnegative integer. c=0 is the lowest-order hyperoperator in the structure. Thus, for integers: c=0 is succession of/on b (in which case a can be omitted or be any number), c=1 is addition, c=2 is multiplication, c=3 is exponentiation, c=4 is tetration, etc. Notice that right-grouping is in effect for all c; thus x*(y*z) is calculated, rather than (x*y)*z.

te'i'ai	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	6-ary mekso/mathematical operator: Heaviside function/step/Theta function of a, of order b, in structure c, using distribution d, within approximated limit e, with value f_b at 0	Explanation: A sequence/family of (strictly monotonically increasingly, ordered) indexed function distributions (d), each of which is of/with respect to/in variable/indeterminant a, is considered; they must have the property that, as the index increases, they converge to some value (described later and determined by b, e, and f_b) for all a. This happens on structure c, which defines what various values and limits mean. b is the 'order' of the result of this convergence (so that it is the bth-order integral (equivalently, -bth-order derivative) of the Heaviside step/Theta function with respect to a so that b = -1 yields the Dirac delta 'function' centered/with interesting point at 0, b = 0 yields the Heaviside step/Theta function with respect to a centered at/with interesting point 0, etc.).  Natural numbers (or 0) for b yield a 'special' polynomial (let us call it p) of that order in indeterminant a for all values of a greater than 0 and 0 for all values of a less than 0 so that p(a) = a^b Theta(a). Input e is for when the particular functions in d are of interest and only e of them have been computed (so that, for finite e, the output is not exactly the bth order Heaviside function); in other words, the limit of the family indices is being taken to e; this is of particular importance for negative values of b: |b| > 1, since they will not be identically 0 in some sense (else, all information is lost about the special structure/nature of this function). The contextless defaults are: b = 0, c is the field of real numbers (with absolute value norm and ordering due to signed absolute value), d is bth-order integral of ((1 + y + z * erf(k a / (2^(1/2)) ) ) / 2)-like functions that are properly normalized and are of proper height, e is infinity (countable). Heaviside(0,0,...,f_0) = 1/2 = f_0 is typical and is a contextless default for b = 0 (however, it may in particular be set to 0 or 1 so that the function is left-/right-continuous at a = 0; for values of b other than 0, f_b = 0 is the contextless default; note that f_(-1) must be infinity 'of the proper magnitude' (it cannot be specified to be otherwise).

tei'au	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	4-ary mekso operator: Taylor expansion/polynomial term; for ordered input (X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4), output is the X_3th Taylor polynomial term of at-least-X_3-smooth function X_2 which was expanded around point X_4 and which is evaluated at point X_1, namely (1/(X_3!)) * (D^{X_3}(X_2))(X_4) * (X_1-X_4)^{X_3}.	All of the usual assumptions must apply in order to be well-defined. X_3 must be a nonnegative integer. X_2 must be a function with at least X_3 derivatives on the interval disc/interval defined by X_1 and X_4 such that said derivative takes values for which the other operators make sense (and finity is usually assumed). X_1 and X_4 must be elements of the domain of X_2 (and the X_3th derivative thereof in the latter case). The notation "(D^{X_3}(X_2))(X_4)" represents the X_3th derivative of X_2, applied to X_4; the "!" notation represents the factorial.

te'o'a	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	unary mekso operator: natural exponentiation operator exp, where exp(a) = e^a \\forall a.	Approximately equivalent to "{se} {te'a} {te'o}" possibly with {ma'o} included somewhere. This is mostly useful for abbreviation and for being careful in distinguishing functions from numbers (since e^x is a number and not a function; this word is e^{\\#} using Wolfram notation). For example: Let D be the differentiation operator with respect to the first variable of its argument. Then D(e^x)=0 at best, strictly speaking, because x must be just a number and so the differentiand is a constant (in fact and at worst, it may not even be a function, in which case the derivative is not even defined); we accept this notation to mean something else (which will be shown momentarily) because few other notations are convenient. However, what we really mean, and what this word facilitates, is: D(exp)=exp; this is true because the differentiand is a differentiable (and special) function. This word is related to {te'a} in a fashion analgpus to the ordered relation between {fa'i} (resp. {va'a}) and {fi'u} (resp. {vu'u}). The domain and codomain sets are purposefully vague.

This word begins a parenthetical which can contain UI cmavo and applies these cmavo as a string of UI to the immediately previous UI cmavo metalinguistically (as if the external UI is/are any other type of word which can be acted upon by UI). An omitted UI (external or internal) in this case is equivalent to {ge'e}.

tu'oi'u	experimental cmavo			   	KOhA7      	end connective string, set, list such that the set of terms provided is exhaustive.	The use of this word in a connective string indicates that the connectands (or entries in a list or elements in the set) are all of the terms for which the speaker knows/intends/believes the statement to be true. Nothing else can fill that terbri or be term in the list or set in that terbri, according to the speaker; those terms which are explicitly mentioned form a complete set of possible terms. "la .alys. .e la .bab. .e tu'oi'e broda" means that Alice brodas, Bob brodas, and no-one else brodas. In some contexts "no lo drata" may not be terribly appropriate or clean; this word should satisfy this need. It differs from simply terminating the terbri because that, in some contexts, leaves open the possibility that the terms explicitly mentioned are all good but the set of terms provided is not exhaustive. {tu'oi} is an empty term; this term is empty but also completes the list in theory.

In these sentences, there is no implication of surprise for the utterer, and possibly not for the other parties; it can even come up in response to a self-posed rhetorical question. It indicates that the claimed truth is contrary to what may be (but not necessarily truly is) one's expectations or previous notions or knowledge or experience.

va'icu'i	cmavo-compound			   	UI*      	discursive: in the same words.	In the CLL {va'i} is defined as "in other words" while {va'i} {nai} is "in the same words", leaving "va'i cu'i" undefined. The entry for this cmavo compound is essentially a proposal to redefine the {va'i} spectrum slightly, to make it a little more like the similar discursive {ta'u}. Consider the English sentences: (A) "Gold has atomic number 79, in other words, there are 79 protons in a gold nucleus." (B) "There are 79 protons in a gold nucleus, in other words, gold has atomic number 79." In English, in both A and B, the parts are discursively connected by the same "in other words" connective, even though the connection is in two mutually opposite directions. To understand that there really is a difference between the two, consider another pair of sentences: (A') "According to the Bible, God made the world in six days, in other words, it took almost a week to make everything around us." (B') "According to the Bible, it took almost a week to make everything around us, in other words, God made the world in six days." Unlike A and B, from among the pair A' and B', only A' makes sense, B' sounds absurd. The proposal is to redefine Lojban's {va'i} and {va'i} {nai}, in the motivation to give {va'i} {nai} more of a use, to reflect this very Lojbanic difference in direction, which English cannot capture. This compound, i.e. "va'i cu'i" would then acquire the meaning of "in the same words". There is no set in stone rule for which of {va'i} and {va'i} {nai} stands for which direction for any given two pair of sentences: however, if one of them is used to connect them in one way, then the other one would connect them in the reverse order. "broda .i va'i nai brode" simply is defined as equivalent to "brode .i va'i broda". See also {ta'u}, a similar discursive that inspired this proposal.

vu'oi	experimental cmavo			   	VUhOI      	opening bracket for VUhO	The binary choice of "VUhO or no VUhO" in the official grammar makes it impossible for instance to say "lo broda .e lo brode .e bo lo brodi" and attach a relative clause (or phrase) only to "lo brode .e bo lo brodi". Either only "lo brodi" receives a relative clause/phrase (simply NOI/GOI) or the entire threesome (VUhO NOI/GOI). The function of VUhOI is as an "elidable starter" - the reverse of an elidable terminator: it explicitly marks the scope of a relative clause/phrase. If elided, it extends as far as possible (equivalent to regular VUhO and consistent with elidable terminators). Examples: "lo broda .e lo brode .e bo ([VUhOI] lo brodi [VUhO] noi brodo)"; "([VUhOI] lo broda .e lo brode .e bo lo brodi vu'o noi brodo)"; "lo broda .e (vu'oi lo brode .e bo lo brodi vu'o noi brodo)". While VUhOI is elidable, it is not possible to say VUhOI and then elide VUhO; consider "vu'oi lo broda .e [VUhOI] lo brode [VUhO] noi brodo [KUhO] vu'o noi brodu" as a counterexample. See also: {vu'o}.

xa'e	experimental cmavo			   	VA      	location tense distance: too far to interact with; subjective	Used when two events can't influence each other because of distance. Example: .i la xunre cu se catra xa'e lonu la blanu cu catlu lo zerzgakacma vidvi -- Red being killed was too far away to be influenced by Blue watching security cameras.
xa'ei	experimental cmavo			   	PU      	time tense relation/direction: disconnected in time/place; causally disjoint	This tense provides a way to re-contextualize the other tenses to work with relativity theory. It declares that the two events are incapable of affecting one another because there isn't sufficient time for light to travel from one event to the other before it occurs, and vice versa. To use tenses with relativity, a {pu} states that the reference point's event occurs in a time and place with sufficient time before the tagged event for light to travel from the reference point to the event. {ba} states that the reference point's event occurs after light from the tagged event could have reached it. {ca} states that light from the tagged event would have reached the reference point about at the same time as the reference point's event. {xa'ei} indicates that no light from either the reference point's event or the tagged event could have reached the other before or during the events. This is an objective form of subjective {xa'e}. See also: {xa'e}, {pu}, {ca}, {ba} See: https://mw.lojban.org/papri/The_proposed_fourth_tense_of_Lojban

Generalizes to n-ary, for any integer n>1 or n being an infinity. This operator generates all three of the basic set operators: union ({jo'e}), intersection ({ku'a}), and relative complement ({kei'i}). See also: {xa'ei'u}. .krtis. calls it the "union(-type) hash operator", but has never seen a generally used name for it.
xa'ei'u	experimental cmavo			   	JOhE      	binary mekso operator: Let the inputs X_1 and X_2 be sets in the same universal set O; then the result of this operator applied to them is X_1^{c}  \\cap X_2^{c}, where for any A \\subseteq O, A^{c} = O \\setminus A.	This is a dual to {xa'ei'o} and largely has the same properties; only one of them is needed in any operator system.

Neither option for these statuses is "picked"; either may be substituted into the bridi and the truth value is claimed to remain the same (namely, True). The other endpoint status may be explicitly be specified to a definitive realization, but the default will be {xai'u'oi} or {xau'u'oi}. See also: {xei'u'oi}, {xau'u'oi}, {xoi'u'oi}.

Joke word, etymologically related to {xa'oi}, {xa'a'a} and {oi}; so laughing from having made that the parser crashes too early. Even if its grammar is totally free (i.e. it can appear anywhere), a parser must answer "syntactically not correct" even if the text without {xa'oi'a'oi'a} was syntactically correct.

xau'e	experimental cmavo			   	XAUhE      	symbol string to number/variable	The following string of PA, BY, and other SYM words are understood to refer to a single number or variable. This word is terminated with the first non-SYM word uttered after it. The SYM words within its scope lose/are divorced from all other meanings, even their definitions; every occurrence of a given sequence in the text (until it is unassigned via {xau'ei}) will refer to the same number when preceded by this word. The number may be treated formally or otherwise and may be evaluated or otherwise.  The use of the word "number" here is extremely broad. The only limitations/restrictions/conditions on a number defined by this word are those imposed upon it by context or those explicitly specified by the utterer.  Useful for ROI, MOI, and quantification (next to gadri). Can also occur in mekso, but would mean essentially the same thing as if the string were not preceded by this word- excepting the fact that if the string is already assigned a meaning, when it is preceded immediately by this word, it may assume an alternative meaning. It produces a number or digit which couples immediately with nearby PA, VUhU, or other mekso words before anything else happens; thus, "xau'e xy su'i pa" is interpreted and evaluated first to mean x+1, this is then treated as a single number (evaluated PA) and is used according to the grammar (such as being a quantifier, for example). See also: {xau'o}, {xau'oi}.
xau'ei	experimental cmavo			   	XAUhO      	text to number/variable unassignment	Terminated by {xau'oi}; this terminator is required. Any enclosed text has all associations with a given number/variable via {xau'e} or {xau'o} erased; no new definition is assigned unless either such meanings/associations are inherent to the string/word(s) (such as by dictionary definition) or the string/word(s) are proceeded by {xau'e} or {xau'o} and terminated as appropriate (in addition to the termination that this word requires).
xau'e'o	experimental cmavo			   	XAUhEhO      	mekso convention default specification/definition (explicit)	This word is followed by a list of rules. The rules specify the convention by which mekso or mathematical expressions (of various kinds) are to be interpreted. Such conventions are taken to remain in effect until the end of the discourse, until repealed, or if the come to conflict with subsequent rules so marked; in the lattermost case, the subsequent rule takes precedent and the earlier rules that are in conflict with it are ignored only in the most minimal domain of application possible (for example, a rule saying "left composition of functions is denoted by "°" in all cases" could be followed by a rule saying "when a linear transformation can be represented by a matrix, left composition of two such functions is equivalent to left multiplication of their corresponding matrices and so their left composition may be represented simply by juxtaposition as is typical with/for multiplication" with result being that "°" is to be used for all left compositions of functions except when both functions being composed are linear transformations admitting matrix representations, in which case "°" could be used but adjacency alone is sufficient to denote their left composition). Collections of rules (ordered in increasing precedence) can be named and referenced by such name expressed instead of those rules at length (such as calling a (specific) rather simple set of rules defining the order of operations ".pemas."). See also: {xau'o'o}.
xau'o	experimental cmavo			   	XAUhO      	text to number/variable	Terminated by {xau'oi}. Any text enclosed by these words is treated as a foreign text, delimited as for {zoi} and {la'o} (that is: by arbitrary valid sound strings that do not occur in the foreign text; I recommend ones that represent the language of origin of the text or a description of what the text is, such as {cmene}/{fangycme}), and is treated formally. The text then is assigned to refer to a single specific number or variable in a manner exactly the same as with {xau'e}. The meaning is unassigned via {xau'ei}. This is good for quoting names and treating them as numbers in mekso, quantifiers, or MOI expressions; the number to which the text refers can be inferred from context or can be explicitly defined.  The word "number" here is extremely broad; the only limitations/restrictions/conditions on the number are those which context demands and those which the utterer explicitly specifies. The quoted text can be used in mekso expressions as a number or digit, just as any PA would be.
xau'oi	experimental cmavo			   	XAUhOI      	XAUhO terminator	Non-elidable.
xau'o'o	experimental cmavo			   	XAUhOhO      	mekso convention cancellation	This word is followed by an evaluated {li} clause (yielding specifically a number n, which probably is a non-negative integer, or a set thereof (the elements of which will also be denoted by simply n, for simplicity) ). It repeals the nth most recent/last convention (counting backward) for mekso/mathematical expressions defined by {xau'e'o}. In order to repeal all such conventions (returning to the conventions specified by some grammar collection), the set should include all integers less than or equal to some sufficiently large integer (which might be {ro}); {ro} denotes the first rule defined (the last rule counting backward from the most recent)- it does not reference "all rules defined"; the most recent rule is denoted by {pa}. Any named body/ordered collection of rules (such as ".pemdas.") is treated as being only one rule for the purposes of such counting.
xau'u'oi	experimental cmavo			   	GAhO      	elliptical/vague interval endpoint status (exclusive/inclusive) marker	Claims that the bridi is true for at least one of the options, but it may or may not be true for both options. The endpoint that is so marked has no grammatical/universal dependency on the status of the other endpoint associated with this word; the math may vary from case to case. Compare to: {xai'u'oi}. See also: {ga'o}, {ke'i}.

xe'a	experimental cmavo			   	PA      	pseudo-number that is unequal to itself.	Used with {xi} subscripts. Used to escape the fact that words like {da}, {ko'a} etc. subscripted with the same index will always refer to the same thing. "da xi xe'a" can refer to a different variable every time it appears, "ko'a xi xe'a" is equivalent to {zo'e}, "broda xi xe'a" is equivalent to {co'e}, etc. See also {xi}, {zo'e}, {co'e}.
xe'au	experimental cmavo			   	XEhAU      	mekso clausal referent bracket initializer	Works with words of selma'o NOIhA. Within a mekso expression, any sequence of words/any subexpression between this word and the (immediate/very) next unmatched member of selma'o NOIhA are consolidated into (one whole and indivisible (for the sake of the clause) entity which acts as reference of the clause introduced by the same member of NOIhA, thus overriding the default attachment of NOIhA cmavo to the word immediately preceding them in a mekso expression. A member of NOIhA is considered "unmatched" if and only if the number of intervening additional uses of this word is less than or equal to the number of members of NOIhA uttered after the usage of this word being considered. The bracketed expression is considered to be a whole and single unit that can only be referenced together and in its single entirety; the bracketed expression is considered to be formal and remains unevaluated for the purposes of the reference/clause- thus, any reference to its evaluated result must be made by modifying {ke'a}. See also: {noi'a}, {poi'a}.

Participants share a virtual space, but are far apart spatially. {xei'e} captures this spatial metaphor precisely: to {zvati} {xei'e} means exactly "to have access to the current communication channel". This metaphor then extends itself to {cliva}, {klama}, {stuzi}, {zvakansa}, saying "{cladu} {fe} {xei'e}", etc.

xei'u'oi	experimental cmavo			   	GAhO      	interval endpoint status (exclusive/inclusive) marker: dependent and coincident/matching with other	Claims that the bridi is true for either option of endpoint so long as the other endpoint matches in status; so, the bridi is claimed to be true for the interval specified so long as both endpoints are the same: either both are inclusive or both are exclusive. Neither option is "picked"; either may be substituted into the bridi and the truth value is claimed to remain the same (namely, True). No claim is made regarding the case of their being different (use "{je} {nai} {xoi'u'oi}" for explicit exclusion of this case). The other endpoint status may be explicitly be specified to a definitive realization, but the default will be {xei'u'oi} as well. See also: {xoi'u'oi}, {xau'u'oi}, {xai'u'oi}.

xe'o	experimental cmavo			   	UI3      	discursive: simply/merely/just, "all there is to it" - not simply, not just, "there's more to it"	In the positive, this conveys that reality is simpler or more restricted than the listener might be thinking; in the negative, it tells the listener that there's more to the truth than they might be thinking. Example: "I'm only/just joking" isn't {mi} {xamsku} {po'o} (that means "all I do is tell jokes") and isn't {mi} {xamsku} {sa'u} (that means "to put it simply, I'm joking" but leaves room for a more complicated {sa'unai} truth). This word offers {mi} {xamsku} {xe'o}. Similarly, {grana} {xe'onai} says that we're talking about "not just a stick" (there's more to it than that: maybe it's a magic wand).
xe'u	experimental cmavo			   	GOhA      	Abstraction variable indicator selbrisle.	{xe'u} is a pro-bridi (meaning it takes the place of a fully-specified bridi). {xe'u} indicates that the {selbrisle} is considered to be a bridi-variable that can be filled by other bridi. {xe'u} makes sense only inside abstraction clauses. In particular, {xe'u} is almost solely used in prenex in order to put a word of selma'o NU in prenex in a statement of predicate logic of third or higher order. See {bu'ai} for usage. See also {ce'u}, {bu'ai}.

xo'ei	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	unary mekso operator: produces a string of n consecutive "xo'e"'s, treated as digits (concatenated into a single string of digits)	n can be any nonnegative integer, (countable) infinity, or vague (in which case it could mean a nonnegative integer or (countable) infinity). The default value of n is vague/elliptical, thus transforming this word into a 0-ary operator. The output is a string of digits, not a number; thus, it automatically attaches to a string of PA's if immediately preceding this word; following digits must be concatenated on; it might be necessary to convert this string into a number (especially if it is isolated and/or is being acted upon an operator that is defined as desired for numbers but not for digits or strings), but the conversion may be automatic according to the grammar (at least in some contexts). {xo'e} is considered to represent exactly one 'digit' (really: PA member) in the given base until it is converted into a number. Since {pi} belongs to PA, technically at least zero {xo'e}'s can actually be meant to be radix point(s); at most, the total allowable number of radix points in a digit string, less the number of explicitly mentioned {pi}'s that occur therein (within the macrodigit), is the number of {pi}'s that can be referenced elliptically by this means. {ma'u} and {ni'u} are possible references for microdigits where allowed by the base.  This word 'knows where it lives', meaning that it will only produce digit strings that are composed of PA's that are allowed by the base and notation given the rest of the context, which form allowed macrodigits, and which will represent part of a context-allowed number. Proposed rafsi: "-xon-", where the default case (n is vague) is assumed (thus, as a rafsi, "-xon-" represents any number that is expressible in the base by a string of concatenated digits and radix point(s) and which makes sense/satisfies implicit conditions placed upon it (such as signum, or being integer, etc.); this meaning is usually described by using variables "n" or "x" in English, such as in: "n-ary", "n-many", "x-meter-long", etc.).
xo'e'o'e	experimental cmavo			   	XOhEhOhE      	elliptical/unspecified/vague single-symbol (general)	Might mean either {bu'o'e} (BY) or {xo'e} (PA), or any other single-symbol selma'o elliptical.

Terminator: {se'u}
xoi'u	experimental cmavo			   	JOI      	non-logical connective (mekso set operator): regardless	Primary motivation is to allow for an analog of .{u} using non-logical connectives of the form of set operators (in the same analogy that related set intersection to logical AND). .krtisfranks. is not sure that this word even fulfills a heretofore unsatisfied logical role, let alone is necessary or practically useful/desirable.
xoi'u'oi	experimental cmavo			   	GAhO      	interval endpoint status (exclusive/inclusive) marker: dependent and contrary/contraposed with other	Claims that the bridi is true for either option of endpoint so long as the other endpoint is opposite in status; so, the bridi is claimed to be true for the interval specified so long as both endpoints are the different: one endpoint must be inclusive while the other is exclusive. Neither option for the order of these statuses is "picked"; either may be substituted into the bridi and the truth value is claimed to remain the same (namely, True). No claim is made regarding the case of their being the same (use "{je} {nai} {xei'u'oi}" for exclusion of this case). The other endpoint status may be explicitly be specified to a definitive realization, but the default will be {xoi'u'oi} as well. See also: {xei'u'oi}, {xau'u'oi}, {xai'u'oi}.

xu'o	experimental cmavo			   	UI7      	attitudinal contour: stronger over time - unchanging intensity - weaker over time	Useful for indicating the rate of change of a previous attitudinal. For example, {ua} {nai} {xu'o} means you're confused, and slowly becoming more so. Use CAI to control the velocity of the change: {ii} {xu'o} {ru'e} means you're scared and slowly getting even more scared.

The immediate next word must be a quote indicator (such as {lu}, {zo}, etc.) or another free modifier (possibly including other members of ZAIhU; for the purposes of these notes, this option will be ignored); the scope of this word terminates simultaneous with the scope of the quote which is introduced by the next word.

If this word is followed by a number of/evaluated to a value 0 or 1 (preceded immediately by "li"), this value is taken to be an explicit reset of the mode to the value indicated (the value in question is called a seed value). Iff the seed value is 1, the mode is set thereinafter to multiplicative style; iff the seed value is 0, the mode is set thereinafter to additive style. (That is: the seed values represent the identity elements under the operation which the mode emulates.).  No other value, numerical or otherwise (including other sumti or even Boolean values, which actually mean "truth" and "false", rather than "1" and "0" respectively, despite common representations), may act as a seed value of this word.  Thus, only in the context of this word being followed by a "li"-introduced mekso expression X which evaluates to the numbers 0 or 1 wherein X is not intended to be taken as a seed value of this word must this word be followed by {ku} prior to X; in this case there is no explicit seed value. If this word has no explicit seed value, then this word causes the mode of interpretation of double-negatives to switch between multiplicative style and additive style; an utterance of this word switches the mode to whichever of these two options was not being used immediately previously.  Thus, it is its own terminator/negator.  Lojban default (without context) is in multiplicative mode: "mi na na nelci" is nearly equivalent to "mi nelci"; double-negatives cancel leaving a positive sense (even if it is not entirely/definitively affirmative). So, one utterance of this word (under standard conventions) in a given discourse will change double-negatives to become additive. This mode is similar to (some) Spanish negation or AAVE negation; multiple negatives compound/add together, intensifying the negativity (subjective truth-value) of an utterance.  In additive mode, "[zau'e'u] mi na na nelci" is equivalent to "mi ba'e na nelci" or something of the like; "[zau'e'u] mi na na na na nelci" would be simply further emphasized (roughly twice as emphatic as the previous example's negation).  This word is intended mostly for stylistic purposes and translations, as well as enabling further cultural neutrality. lai .krtisfranks. requests that this word (and all of its relevant information, including the selma'o label) be mapped to "{zau'eu}" if the string "eu" ever becomes officially accepted in Lojban.

Technically, it means: "For any finite n > 0, there exists a finite x such that n < |x|; this word refers to such an x". This is different from "infinite" in the same way that living literally and truly forever in an undying universe is different from living for as long as was initially desired but for a finite time (and eventually dying). No assumption about signum; the above definition is given in absolute value terms. In other words, the typical meaning of "arbitrarily and positively large" is "{ma'uzau'u}", meanwhile "arbitarily large in absolute value but negative" is given by "{ni'uzau'u}". See also: {mei'a}.

zei'ei	experimental cmavo			   	ZEIhEI      	begin quote that is converted into rafsi	Terminated by {zei'oi}. Quotes an utterance (must be grammatical) and converts it (as a whole) into a single rafsi with the meaning of "something to do with the referent of "[insert quoted text]"". Notably, does not distribute through the text, treating each word individually with left-grouping (it does not distribute {zei} before and/or after each word (as needed)); the quoted utterance is taken as a whole unit of meaning unto itself; for the former purpose, see {zei'ei'au}. This word is useful for forming quotes and mathematical expressions (formal, evaluated, or otherwise) into lujvo. This rafsi is assumed to begin the next word if the preceding text/utterance does not end with an otherwise standalone and ungrammatical rafsi (the grammar in such a situation should be discussed); in order to connect it as a rafsi within a lujvo that began before it, precede the quotation with {zei}. In order to finish a lujvo or treat the quotation as a brivla on its own, follow it with {co'e}, which is treated as if the preceding utterance (the quote) is a single word followed immediately by {zei}; in order to string multiple ZEIhEI-ZEIhOI rafsi together follow this formula: zei'ei broda zei'oi co'e zei zei'ei brode zei'oi (co'e (zei...))... . Individual rafsi outside of lujvo are typically not grammatical (except in certain quotation structures, vel sim.).
zei'ei'au	experimental cmavo			   	ZEIhEI      	begin quote that is converted into rafsi, distributing lujvo-glue between quoted words	Terminated by {zei'oi}. Begins a quote of a grammatical utterance. Between each word in the utterance, {zei} is to be interpreted and any grouping that might be applied is left-grouping. In other words, {zei} is distributed left-groupingly between each word; each word is treated on its own, individually; the quote is not treated as a whole. The final word is interpreted to have {zei} after it as well (this is a quirk of {zei'oi}), thus the quote is a string of rafsi, left-groupingly considered to be a rafsi. In order to end the lujvo formed with such a quote, follow it by {co'e}. This word compactifies large {zei}-clauses/-statements. For the perhaps generally more useful, if slightly more ambiguous, quote marker that treats the quote as a whole entity and converts it singly and wholly into a rafsi (rather than a rafsi string, as is done by this word), see: {zei'ei}. This word works as {zei'ei} does in all other regards (including as a marker for a new word (specifically a lujvo) unless preceded by {zei} or possibly by a standalone and otherwise ungrammatical rafsi). For the purpose of quoting with {ra'oi}, the result of a {zei'ei'au}-quote is treated as a single rafsi.

zei'o	experimental cmavo			   	ZIhOI      	Delete all sumti slots of the immediately preceding word which are not explicitly filled excepting the first n (specified by subscript; contextless default: n=0).	Use SE in order to reorder the sumti slots. Typically, the word in question should be a non-cmavo brivla, but this is not always the case. When used as a rafsi, it modifies the last veljvo and deletes all except the first n (subscripted) sumti slots (regardless of any inferred relations between them and the sumti slots of other companion veljvo,  or of any implied filling (unless such is actually explicit), which otherwise would or could exist); in rafsi form, the subscript is implied to be 1 (meaning that all except the first unfilled sumti slot is deleted) unless explicitly specified otherwise, else veljvo structure no longer makes much sense; the subscript marker "{xi}" (proposed rafsi: "-xix-") is required for explicit specification of the subscript unless there is a veljvo bracket or tanru-grouping modifier (such as  "{ke'e}") which makes such interpretation the only possible option from a syntactic, semantic, AND practical standpoint. Proposed rafsi: "-zes-" (because the last letteral for it should be able to cluster tightly with "-xix-").

zi'au	experimental cmavo			   	KOhA      	nonexistent/undefining it; the selbri is not applicable when the other terbri are filled in the manner in which they are in this utterance/bridi.	In words for math which have a terbri for the result of an operation, filling that terbri with this word indicates not that the operation evaluates but rather that the operation cannot be applied to the given inputs at all; the operation on those inputs is undefined or has no existing well-defined solution(s). Given the other sumti in the predicate (filling the corresponding terbri), the underlying relation (selbri) is claimed to be invalid in this circumstance. Examples: "non-integrable", "non-measurable" (confer: ".{umre}"), "non-summable" (say, of strings), "the limit does not exist". This avoids the necessity of creating a pair of words for every such mathematical concept (one for when the operation may be applied to the inputs so as to yield a well-defined value which may be specified and one for when such is not the case). Other uses may develop or be found. This word does not 'delete' the terbri (unlike "{zi'o}"); it simply says that the selbri is not really applicable. Whether or not the meaning of this word is within the generic semantic range of "{zo'e}" is debatable and not yet well-established. The conventions employed matter. The case of the product of zero and infinity usually must be handled by a separate definition (especially when dealing only with strictly real numbers); it is quite common to explicitly handle this case by defining the product as zero, but prior to such definition, "lo pilji be li no bei li ci'i" is meaningless and undefined (the symbols can be written but do not actually mean anything) - so, pilji_1 should be filled with this word in such a circumstance. As another example, unless the difference of infinity with infinity is defined (and following the convention that unconnected points have a graph distance of positive countable infinity), which is unnatural, the relationship represented by "{tseingu}" is undefined in its fourth terbri (so, it can be filled with this word) when its first and second sumti belong to mutually different trees (leaving their most recent mutually common ancestor undefined). Notice that the other terbri are well-defined in this circumstance - in particular, tseingu_3 is positive countable infinity; also notice that this word has a slightly less mathematical flavor (especially insofar as the first terbri is not result of applying a mathematical operation to the following terbri) than many other ready examples. Yet another example: In a zero-dimensional universe, klama_4 and possibly klama_5, as well as even more arguably klama_2, are undefined (and can be filled with this word), leaving the notion of 'going' empty and meaningless. In a (-1)-dimensional universe (an empty set), every terbri of "{klama}" (and probably every other word) is undefined and can be filled with this terbri.

The next bu-letteral is absorbed and a sharp accidental is given to it; e.g. "zi'e'e gy" means "the note G-sharp". Use {zi'e'i} for double sharps or subscript this cmavo to refer to a multiple of the sharp, e.g. for triple sharps or half sharps. Subscripting with a negative value will refer to flats instead.

Deletion is only meaningful if the immediately previous word is a brivla with at least one unfilled (explicitly) terbri. In a tanru or other complicated construct, only the most recent word undergoes this terbri deletion (not every term in the construct). A selbri converted to a sumti by gadri has x1 terbri filled for the purposes of this word; likewise is the case for terbri accessed by {be} or {bei}; seltau in the main level of a sumti are filled by the gadri as well for the purposes of this word.

Treats the quote as a substitute for some formal collection of rules or mathematical description/definitions/notations; the exact meaning of the quote must be inferred as is the case with {la} or any quote; the quote is treated as a single block of text representative a single entity so described in only that case/context by the utterer; can be used to clarify the interpretation of text (convention specification; text need not be mathematical (in which case, it must be used in a meta-linguistic scope)) or as an operand of certain mathematical operators (or, more generally perhaps, bridi).  Might be useful for quoting names as descriptors for arguments of operands.

zu'a	cmavo			   	FAhA2      	location tense relation/direction; leftwards/to the left of ...
zu'ai	experimental cmavo			   	KOhA7      	shows mutual activity between this place and the first place of the current bridi; members participating in the activity are put into the first place (that e.g. can be formed by connecting sumti with {ce} or {jo'u})	See also {simxu}, {zi'o}
zu'au	experimental cmavo			   	FAhA2      	location tense relation/direction (angular); counterclockwise from..., locally leftwards/to the left of ...	See also: {zucna}, {du'oi}.

zu'i'a	experimental cmavo			   	KOhA      	typically what?	Ask what {zu'i} in the place means.  From {zu'i} + {ma}. It will be usually used to learn brivla.
zu'o	cmavo   	-zum-		   	NU1      	abstractor: activity (event) abstractor; x_1 is abstract activity of [bridi] composed of x_2.
zu'oi	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mekso; binary operator: z-score for the X_1 quantile; X_2 (default: 1) acts as the descriptor toggle (see notes).	If X_2 = 0, then X_1 is to be interpreted as a quantile and the output is the corresponding (canonical-gaussian) z-score; if X_2 = 1 (which is the default), then X_1 is to be interpreted as the area below the canonical gaussian and between the output number of standard deviations from the mean of the canonical gaussian. Thus, zu'oi(X_1, 1) = zu'oi((1/2) + (X_1 / 2), 0). Example: zu'oi(.95, 1) = zu'oi(.975, 0) = 1.959964...; for more information on this example, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1.96 . For the purposes of this definition, the canonical guassian is such that its mean is 0 and its standard deviation is 1. This number is used in confidence interval calculations, via the sample mean and standard error.
