bai'i	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mekso string operator (ternary): find-and-replace; in string/text/word/sequence X1 formally replace X2 (ordered tuple of terms to be replaced) with X3 (ordered tuple of terms to be respectively substituted)	X2 and X3 are ordered tuples of substrings/letters/characters/letterals/digits/numerals. The ith term in tuple X2 is replaced with the ith term in tuple X3; the replacements are executed simultaneously (thus, no overlap/contradiction can be allowed to arise in the substitution- in particular, in X2)  - alternatively, if there is overlap/conflict in/between the terms of X2, the replacements are performed in order of presentation (the ith term in X2 is replaced by the ith term in X3, and then the (i+1)th term in X2 is replaced with the (i+1)th term in X3, starting with the 1st term in each). X2 and X3 must have the same length/number of terms - alternatively, X3 cannot be longer/have more terms than X2; in this situation, the ith term of X2 is replaced with the ith term of X3 until and including when the last term of X3 is reached, after which point the remaining terms in X2 are not replaced at all. Use a permutation acting on X2 as the argument for X3 in order to rearrange the substrings of X1; if the alphabet is ordered, then operators can be applied to the letters in order to rotate through the alphabet. In particular, if X1 is a binary string (a word over an alphabet of two letters) and X2 is the 2-tuple of the letters of that binary alphabet (length-1 substrings), then without specification of X3, this operator defaults to bitwise binary negation (bit conjugation) wherein each letter in X1 is replaced by the unique other letter in the binary alphabet (otherwise, the replacement would be the identity/trivial replacement or just a formal substitution letter-by-letter which does not really change the nature of the word). X1 and each entry in X2 and X3 should be quoted, match a necessary type (such as being a character), or be abstracted a level by symbolics. In general, the replacement is formal and the strings in X3 need not be over the same alphabet as the one over which X1 is written. This operator is useful for combinatorial lines and for expanding digits (such as, in a binary string, replacing each occurrence of "0" with "01" and each occurrence of "1" with "10"; note that the replacement is instantaneous and simultaneous for all terms of X2 and every occurrence of such terms in X1, thus this substitution is perfectly acceptable).

bu'ai	experimental cmavo			   	NU      	abstractor: abstractor to create logically quantified selbri variable to be used in predicate logic of third or higher order.	{zo'e} and {da} are a constant and a bound variable of predicate logic of first order respectively; {co'e} and {bu'a} are a selbri constant and a bound selbri variable of predicate logic of second order respectively; in order to express predicate logic of third or higher order, it is essential to have selbri that treat selbri variables in the domain of all selbri of second order. {su'u} and {bu'ai} in selma'o NU can compose respectively a selbri constant and a bound selbri variable in the domain of all selbri of second order. In the case that {bu'ai} takes plural number of selbri variables, connect them with {ju'e} or something. Higher order is also possible by nesting {bu'ai}.

(Use {bo'ai} for more places if needed, or {ce'u} for "next place"). // {cei'e} is meant to be used to define new words (implicit {ca'e}) but may be modified by evidentials to express an assertion ({ju'a}) or opinion ({pe'i}) on a meaning instead. Alternatively, {smuni} and {ka'ei} may be used. // See {cei}, {goi}, {goi'e}

ce'oi	experimental cmavo			   	JOI      	argument list separator: acts as a comma between arguments in an argument list supplied to a function.	"ce'oi" is the word of choice to separate the arguments in bridi_3. Using {ce'o} there has obvious limitations when the selbri actually calls for a sequence. Obviously, ce'oi has issues too if the selbri can accept an argument list, but this can be circumvented more readily with {ke}...{ke'e} brackets than it can with {ce'o}. Consider ".i lo ka broda cu selbri fi ko'a ce'o ko'e". Without inspecting the type requirements of {broda} and the respective types of {ko'a} and {ko'e}, one cannot determine the meaning of the {bridi}. Furthermore, if one accepts non-static typing of {sumti} places, multiple correct answers can be given for a question asking what is the bridi_1. This would create ambiguity that is otherwise resolved by "ce'oi". See also {ka}, {du'u}, {me'au}

It can also be subscripted with {xi}, and will terminate that many times. Note that that means grammatical function is being put in a {xi} clause, so be careful when using it. Additionally, cu'au {xi} {ro} will terminate all the way up to the last sentence-starting word (.i mi klama lo zarci pe lo pendo be mi cu'au xi ro -> .i mi klama lo zarci pe lo pendo be mi cu'au-be'o-ku-ge'u-ku-vau). This will also terminate to sentences started in {lu} (will NOT emulate li'u UNLESS used multiple times), {ni'o}, and {no'i}. It will NOT emulate {le'u}. In addition to {ro}, it can be subscripted with {da'a}, which terminates to the sentence level, minus 1. In the previous example, this would just leave the {vau} remaining, and allow you to continue to add to the place structure of {klama}.

If binary, a single number n must be supplied for the first variable and the second variable must be a list (k_1,...,k_s); for appropriate values, the output is (n!)/((k_1 !) * ((n - k_1)!) *...* (k_s !) * ((n - k_s)!)); note that this is not exactly the typical definition, but it allows for easier immediate usage for the binomial case (where s=1).

da'a'au	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mekso operatory: prime mark append	For ordered inputs (A, B, C), where A is a general mathematical object, B is an integer (normally nonnegative), and C is a nonnegative integer; appends B prime(s)/distinguishing marks of type C to A. Presumably objects that have the same symbol as A but different B and C values are mutual(ly) related/analogs, but are at least formally distinguishable. B and C each default to 1. In practice, tick marks are usually called prime marks (and probably will effectively/culturally have a value of C=1); other distinguishing features are employed usually once these are used, such as overbars, over-tildes/over-twiddles, dagger, asterisks, etc. For a fixed C, this operator forms a series in B for each A. The meaning is context-specific. B = 0 iff C = 0; if A in unprimed (lacks any distinguishing marks), then B = 0; thus all mathematical objects have this operator implicitly attached to them with the value of 0 for the second and third argumentsize (note that this is not the default value for these arguments when this operator is explicitly mentioned). It is possible therefore to reference both primed and unprimed objects of form A simultaneously via reference to, for example, (1±1)/2 for the value for B and/or C (employing the setting of defaulting to the value of 1 as appropriate).

The terbri are not filled by this word. Usage is only meaningful for a brivla with at least one terbri (regardless of being explicitly filled or otherwise). In a tanru or other complicated construct, only the most recent word undergoes this terbri default restoration (not every term in the construct). A selbri converted to a sumti by gadri has the x1 terbri filled for the purposes of this word, but the default setting of that terbri is so restored all the same; likewise is the case for terbri accessed by {be} or {bei}; seltau in the main level of a sumti are filled by the gadri as well for the purposes of this word.

de'ai	experimental cmavo			   	DEhAI      	default value (re)specification/(re)assignment/(re)definition/over-write; set new default value (terbri-specific; permanent)	Terminates immediately previous sumti.  The immediately following (next) unfilled terbri at that level of nesting is affected by this word; if no such terbri exists at that level of nesting, this word's affects apply to the next unfilled terbri in the immediately higher level of nesting (unnested once); if no unfilled terbri exist at any/all levels of nesting and following the immediately previous sumti (even if unfilled terbri exist prior to that sumti), this word has no meaningful affect and can be ignored.  This word must be followed by a sumti; for the purpose of this explanation, this sumti will be xy (as in "de'ai xy").  The affected terbri is defined to default to the value xy (the sumti as a whole, including gadri, tanru, relative clauses, etc.); in other words, when not explicitly filled or when filled be {di'au}, the sumti value filling the affected terbri is that of xy.  This affect remains in effect until the end of the text/conversation or until/unless the default setting of this terbri explicitly redefined (overriding by {di'ei} is temporary/only applies to that usage). If xy is {zo'e}, the default value is completely general and elliptical; thus, permanently overriding a default setting on a specific terbri may be done by "de'ai zo'e". The scope of this word fully encompasses and ends with the following sumti (xy); thus, the second sumti, same-/higher-level terminator, a FA cmavo, etc. following this word ends the new default specification in addition to its other functions.  Additionally, this word does not actually fill the affected terbri with any particular sumti/value; it merely defines its default value hereinafter. CAUTION: Thus, the second same-level sumti uttered actually fills the affected terbri; in order to access the newly-defined default value of the terbri immediately after definition, follow "xy" (with terminator) immediately with implicit (or possibly explicit) "{zo'e}" (possibly necessitating terminators), "{di'au}", or "xy" itself. Moreover, therefore, the default value defined by this word does not immediately/necessarily affect the truth value of the statement in which it appears (it only does so if the second following sumti is not {di'au}, implicit (or possibly) explicit {zo'e}, or xy itself); however, in all future uses of the brivla to which the terbri belongs, unless explicitly filled with a sumti of a different value, the truth value of those statements will be affected.  Also, {su} does not erase this new definition of default. If the affected terbri is naturally defined to have a default or if it has no naturally defined default value, this word semi-permanently over-writes them. See also: {dai'o}, {de'au}, {de'ei}, {de'oi}, {di'au}, {di'ei}, {di'oi}.

The terbri are not filled by this word. Usage is only meaningful for a brivla with at least one terbri (regardless of being explicitly filled or otherwise). In a tanru or other complicated construct, only the most recent word undergoes this terbri default override (not every term in the construct). A selbri converted to a sumti by gadri has the x1 terbri filled for the purposes of this word, but the default setting of that terbri is so overridden all the same; likewise is the case for terbri accessed by {be} or {bei}; seltau in the main level of a sumti are filled by the gadri as well for the purposes of this word. The cancellation is only effective for the single occurrence/instant/usage of this word (the next use of the affected word will be implicitly accompanied by its terbri defaults, as defined elsewhere (by official definition or by other (permanent) modifications made to the word)).

di'au	experimental cmavo			   	KOhA7      	pro-sumti and sumyzmico: discourse-interior default it (terbri-specific)	Explicitly and emphatically references the specified default value of the relevant terbri as specified/designated by the discourse; thus, its value is context-dependent and subject to specification modifications. It does not necessarily reference the value defined "officially". ({zo'e}, implicit or explicit, may do so as well, but the use of this word implies some degree of a more deliberate choice to follow the default specification.) When a default of the terbri is not specified by the previous discourse (nor by the discourse-exterior "official" definition of the terbri if not specification modifications have been made previously), this word is equivalent to completely general and elliptical {zo'e}. See also: {di'oi}, {di'ei}.

Thus, there is no simple way to reference the "general" elliptical/unspecified value for these sumti, other than by using this word.  {zo'e} typically is interpreted as meaning any value of some general and unspecified set of potential sumti referents, modulated by context and the need to make the statement true; in the case of an explicit default setting of a terbri by the definition of a word, {di'ei} takes on this general and unspecified meaning, effectively ignoring the default (although it can take on the value of that default (doing so, simply, is just not necessary)); when no default is specified for the terbri in the definition, this word has the same meaning as {zo'e}.

(zo'e, implicit or explicit, may do so as well, but the use of this word implies some degree of a more deliberate choice to follow the discourse-exterior default specification.) When a default is not specified by the definition of a word, this word is equivalent to completely general and elliptical {zo'e}. See also: {di'au}, {di'ei}, {zmico}.

Resets all defaults (default specifications) in the (terbri) structure of immediately previously uttered word so that implicit/omitted {zo'e} and {di'au} that may fill the terbri of that word are predefined/specific in reference and do indeed necessarily agree with the default setting explicitly specified in the discourse-exterior/”official” definition of the word. The terbri are not filled by this word. Usage is only meaningful for a brivla with at least one terbri (regardless of being explicitly filled or otherwise). In a tanru or other complicated construct, only the most recent word undergoes this terbri default restoration (not every term in the construct).

Also may indicate a cultural or linguistic gap. For Lojban especially, it might be useful when various ambiguities arise in the original text and the translator is forced to pick interpretations from among them.

Really useful when mapping from a countable set/object that is either human-small or in which the pattern is clear. Occasionally used for a more explicit form of notation for permutations (in which cycle decomposition is not necessarily as evident, but the structure as a how is, at least, explicit). The ith term of X1 is mapped to the ith term of X2; there is no knowledge of what happens to any value that is not term of list X1.  Useful for lambda calculus.

Automatically unassigns the variable from any previous assignment. May also be used for pronouns like {mi} or {do} or {dei}. This is useful to refer to {mi} as a 'first-person pronoun' rather than the actual speaker themself, for example, when giving the definition of {mi'o}: '{mi} {ge'ei} {jo'u} {do} {ge'ei}', makes it clear that the speaker doesn't literally mean the speaker and the listener, but are using {mi} and {do} metasyntactically.

If applied to an element of an algebraic structure, one has the options to specify the structure in which its order is being considered and/or the operator with respect to which its order is being considered (for example, in a given ring, an elements additive order is usually not its multiplicative order), although either of these made remain vague and be inferred from context; order is the smallest non-negative number of applications of the operator needed to be applied (in composition) to the original element in order for it to result in the identity element of the structure (thus, order is not always finite or even defined).

In this notation, each term maps to the the subsequent term as read from left to right or heard in chronological order of utterance; the last term (immediately before {tei'u}) maps to the first term. The object constructed is a cyclic permutation, a group element. The singleton cycle is identity on that term. It can be applied to a single element among its terms or may left group act upon a set or structure, or an element if the application is not directly upon it (such as when the application is to an index or variable of that element). Permutations are composed when viewed from outside of their group structure and have the group operator act upon them when within that context. The transposition (1  2) is expressed as ' li ja'oi pa boi re tei'u '. See also: {tei'u}, {ma'o'e}, {gu'ai}, {ru'ei}, {fa'ai}.

Not literally the number of symbols used, but the number of meaningful "spots" occupied; for example "(1,0)" uses five characters, but its length is just 2 (for "1" and then "0"); this is due to the fact that formal representation may vary but the amount of information conveyed must remain constant.

jo'au	experimental cmavo			   	COI3      	change version/dialect of parser	{do'u} is the elidable terminator. The morphology and the grammar of cmevla/sumti/selbri following {jo'au} should conform to the version 134 of the page ``BPFK Section: PEG Morphology Algorithm'' on the website lojban.org and the official grammar so that a {jo'au} clause forms a free modifier compatible with every version/dialect of lojban parser: for example, ``jo'au jie bu'' and ``jo'au xy xi xei'' are not meaningful clauses. As a standard usage, {jo'au} clause appears at the very beginning of the whole text, just as the inverse of the usage of {fa'o}. The scope of the meaning of {jo'au} clause spans over the following part until the next {jo'au} clause appears. Optionally, if the first {jo'au} clause appears in the middle of a text, the meaning of it spans from the beginning of the text until the next {jo'au} clause appears. Examples of meaning: jo'au cylyly xi papipa (official yacc and jbofi'e http://www.lojban.org/jboski/ ); jo'au camxes (current peg http://camxes.lojban.org/ ); jo'au iocixes (zasni gerna of la xorxes https://skami2.iocikun.jp/lojban/zasniGerna , http://www.lojban.org/tiki/zasni+gerna ); jo'au zantufa xi nopipapa (zantufa version 0.11 http://guskant.github.io/gerna_cipra/zantufa-0.11.html ); jo'au ilmentufa xi renopavopi'epapapi'erevo (ilmentufa version 2014-11-24 http://mw.lojban.org/extensions/ilmentufa/camxes-exp.html , https://github.com/Ilmen-vodhr/ilmentufa ); jo'au fancylojban (fancylojban http://mw.lojban.org/lmw/fancylojban , http://mw.lojban.org/lmw/ce_ki_tau_jau .); jo'au gadganzu (gadri reinterpretation/reassignment proposal, http://mw.lojban.org/papri/zipcpi:_Yet_another_gadri_article ; no grammar changes, only semantic)

ju'au	experimental cmavo			   	JUhAU      	semi-mathematical binary operator: named number base operator/interpreter	Follows a number and is followed by a sumti string (introduced with appropriate gadri, multiple sumti strung together via connectives); scope terminates with the end of the sumti and/or with {ke'e'au}. The construct as a whole syntactically functions as a parenthetical so that mekso may be resumed immediately thereafter without any difficulty. This word attaches to/affects the immediately preceding macrodigit string extending from the last evaluated number, number operation, etc. or bracket to/until this word. The preceding number is semantically interpreted according to the description to which the following sumti refers. If a sequence is supplied as the following sumti, the preceding number is interpreted so that each digit, starting from the left (default: see next), is understood as a multiple of the corresponding value in the sequence under the ordering given (which may produce an invalid/ill-formed result; the placement of {pi} matters as well).  If a single number is submitted (such as "li {dau}"), this word acts as {ju'u}; the number is interpreted according to the rules of mekso and is its own island for such interpretation (thus {ju'u} is needed to override a cultural/grammatical default interpretation, such as decimal, even if this is done within the mekso expression outside of and including the scope of this word). In this way, the sumti being (10^n)_n, which is a sequence, is the same as the sumti being just 10, but is very different from it being the sequence (10)_n.  The original default for numeral-position/string reading/interpretation is from left-to-right, where a digit on the left in a pair of digits represents that multiple of a "later" term in the sequence as compared to right member of the pair; thus "23" in decimal means (2*(10^1)) + (3*(10^0)), which is twenty-three.  This default may be overridden via specification of the sequence (either its ordering, its domain being negated, or alteration to the base); alternatively, and perhaps more easily, the appearance of "la'e zoi jbo. ri'u bi'o zu'a .jbo" will always reverse it (this is a special input value with interpretation defined by this grammar); when reversed, "23" in decimal means (2*(10^0)) + (3*(10^1)), which is to say thirty-two.  Generally, this word overrides the default interpretation of a string of microdigits when computing the value of a macrodigit (see: {ju'u'i}). See also: {ju'u}, {ju'u'i}, {pi'e}.

ju'u'i	experimental cmavo			   	JUhUhI      	long-digit interpretation specifier; macrodigit named base specifier	When a string of multiple digits is on either side of {pi'e}, the string is to be interpreted as a single "macrodigit" in the longer numeric string; let the digits that compose it be called "microdigits" for clarity. By default, the macrodigit is interpreted as being written/expressed in some cultural or grammatical default (this default is overridden by {ju'au} if its specifying sumti requires an alternative interpretation for the value of the macrodigits), probably decimal- the interpretation of the string of microdigits produces a number, x; the "{pi'e}" implies the denominator to be used in determining the fraction for which x is in the numerator and context or possibly a specified base determines its value- in timekeeping, the interpretation is typically x/60 for certain macrodigits. However, the default for determining the value of x given a string of microdigits might be useful to override (for example, Tsohnai uses an overall factorial base but each macrodigit is written in balanced quinary); this word specifies the base used for interpreting the macrodigit from a string of microdigits. It is placed at the end of the string (possibly before the next "{pi'e}") and its scope of effect extends from there, through the string of microdigits, to either the beginning of the number as a whole or the most recent "{pi'e}" (whichsoever was more recently uttered). It is to be followed by a sumti (or multiple sumti strung together by connectives) and has its scope of specification terminate with that sumti; in this regard, it works syntactically and semantically exactly like {ju'au}. In fact, {ju'au} can be used outside of the number in order to specify the macrodigit interpretation instead of this word (for example, if its sumti were la .tsonais., this word would not be needed); however, if only a sequence were to have been given as the argument of {ju'au} (such as the factorial sequence) and if some base other than decimal were desired for the interpretation of each macrodigit from the string of microdigits, then this word would be used. If only one macrodigit appears in the number, then this word is equivalent to {ju'au}. In short, the scope of this word is one contiguous string of microdigits, and it influences their interpretation into a macrodigit value in the same way that {ju'au} does. However, if both {ju'au} and this word specify how to interpret a given string of microdigits in the same number (composed of macrodigits), this word overrides the interpretation specified by {ju'au} (but only for this macrodigit); thus, for example, a Tsohnai number can have each of its macrodigits be interpreted in balanced quinary except one, which the speaker specifies via this word, because they know the value but did not want to convert it to balanced quinary (because it may be too large or hard to do so easily), so they instead expressed it in decimal.

ke'ei'a	experimental cmavo			   	KEhEIhA      	Toggles to left grouping of tanru.	rafsi -kex- Toggles back to left grouping after ke'ei toggles right grouping or ke'ai toggles to no grouping.
ke'e'u	experimental cmavo			   	KEhEhU      	Locks tanru modification order reversal (does not affect lujvo). {ke'e'unai} restores regular order	Makes all tanru in the following text "selskiski"/"military-style": i.e. {tertau} come *before* {seltau}. This essentially puts {ke'oi} before every tanru. // This is an experimental cmavo in the truest sense of the word, used to test out "what if" Lojban chose "noun-adjective"  order, which does have several advantages (chief of them being that the selbri-unit that describes the subject is uttered first), despite being unusual for English speakers.
kei	cmavo   	-kez-		   	KEI      	elidable terminator: end abstraction bridi (often elidable).
ke'i	cmavo			   	GAhO      	open interval bracket marker; modifies intervals in non-logical connectives; exclude boundaries.
kei'ai	experimental cmavo			   	PEhO      	mekso style converter: elementwise application of operator	Prefixed to an operator/function that operates on numbers, thereby transforming it to a set operator (thus its arguments must be sets where before they were numbers), as defined in a given structure. Produces the set of all numbers that are given by some ordered pair of elements (the nth term of which belongs to the nth set specified) with the operator acting on them (per the rules of that operator). The set produced may include empty terms and/or infinity. Let "✦" represent the operator; then X_1 kei'ai ✦ X_2 boi X_3 boi X_4 = Set(x_1✦x_2✦x_3✦x_4: x_i in X_i). See also {kei'au} for a similar but different word.
kei'au	experimental cmavo			   	KEIhAU      	mekso operator: finite result set derived from/on set A with/due to operator/function B under ordering of application C	Equivalent to: lo'i li zy du ca'e li pe'o se'au mau'au B zai'ai vei ma'o xy boi ny ve'o boi tau sy boi C ku poi ke'a cmaci xanri zi'e poi ke'a mleca li ci'i zo'u tau sy klesi A. Acts on an operator/function (b) and produces all finite results of that operator being used on any allowable number of elements of the set A without repetition within any given application. The result must be defined (and finite, obviously). Application of the operator on nothing (the elements of the empty set) is generically allowed and follows convention (for example, an empty sum may evaluate to 0). Differs from {kei'ai}. Use {mau'au} and {zai'ai} for quoting B. C will be specified explicitly (possibly elsewhere) and/or via {zoi'ai}.
kei'i	experimental cmavo			   	KEIhI      	non-logical connective/mekso operator - variable arity: X1 \\ X2	Ordered: 'x1 kei'i x2' is not generally the same as/equivalent to 'x2 kei'i x1'. If X1 is not explicitly specified, it is taken to be some universal set in the discourse (of which all other mentioned sets are subsets, at the least); in this case, the word operates more as the set (absolute) complement. When X1 is specified, it represents the set relative complement. Somewhat analogous to logical NOT (just as intersection is analogous to logical AND, union is analogous to logical AND-OR). The preferred description/name in English is "set (theoretic) exclusion".

ke'oi	experimental cmavo			   	KE      	reverses modification order of contained tanru (does not affect lujvo).	Marks a "selskiski"/"military-style"/"noun-adjective" tanru, i.e. {tertau} come *before* {seltau}. This differs from {co} in that it does not affect the place structure of the sumti to the right; i.e. in {mi ke'oi broda brode do} (= {mi brode broda do}), both {mi} and {do} are arguments of {broda}. Default grouping is still left: {lo ke'oi ckule nixli cmalu melbi} resolves to {lo ke'oi (((ckule nixli) cmalu) melbi)}, which is equivalent to {lo melbi ke cmalu ke nixli ckule}. {co} does not (re-)reverse the order of tanru-modification; it only changes place structure. See {ke'e'u}.

See also {lai'e} of LAhE, {la'ai} of LOhU and {la'o} of ZOI for naming cmavo.
la'e	cmavo			   	LAhE      	the referent of (indirect pointer); uses the referent of a sumti as the desired sumti.
la'e'au	experimental cmavo			   	LAhE      	the specific referent of [following sumti] defined/specified by the grammar	The grammar in question can itself be specified by metalinguistic tags that apply to the utterance; if not explicitly specified, then a cultural assumption/default is applied. This word is useful for distinguishing between, for example, differentiating between something that the speaker happens to call "PEMDAS" and the order of operations PEMDAS (which, presumably, could be included in the grammar as a special word that influences mekso interpretation); likewise for a font that happens to be called ".{mekrot}." ("math blackboard bold") and the one that definitely refers to the set of characters used for, among other purposes, set notation.

la'i	cmavo			   	LA      	name descriptor: the set of those named ... ; takes name or selbri description.
lai'e	experimental cmavo			   	LAhE      	Named reference. It converts a sumti into another sumti. The converted sumti points to the referent the name of which is the referent of the unconverted sumti.	``lai'e ko'a''=``zo'e noi se cmene ko'a''. {lai'e} is a cmavo of LAhE, and followed by any sumti including ``lo se du'u BRIDI'', ``zo...'', ``lu...li'u'', ``lo'u...le'u'' or ``zoi...'', used with an elidable terminater {lu'u}. For example, ``lai'e lo se du'u ti brife doi la betis'' refers to something the name of which is a text in a language that means ``ti brife doi la betis'', while ``la'e lo se du'u ti brife doi la betis'' refers to the same as ``lo du'u ti brife doi la betis''. The syntax of sumti following {lai'e} is analysed by the parser, while the syntax of strings following {la'ai} or {la'o} is ignored. In the cases that {lai'e} is followed by {lu}, {lo'u} or {zoi}, the referent is the same as that of sumti formed by {la'au}, {la'ai} or {la'o} respectively: ``lai'e lu ti brife doi la betis li'u (lu'u)''=``la'au ti brife doi la betis li'u''; ``lai'e lo'u se ly van beti le'u (lu'u)''=``la'ai se ly van beti le'u''; ``lai'e zoi zoi C'est le vent, Betty zoi (lu'u)''=``la'o zoi C'est le vent, Betty zoi''. See also {la'e}, {la}, {la'o}, {la'ai}, {la'au}; {lu'u}; {cmene}.

le'ai	experimental cmavo			   	LEhAI      	replace recent mistakenly uttered text	The {lo'ai} ... {sa'ai} ... {le'ai} replacement construct asks the listener to replace the text after {lo'ai} with the text after {sa'ai}.  The order {sa'ai} ... {lo'ai} ... {le'ai} is also allowed, and either or both parts can be omitted and thus left up to context.  When both parts are omitted, the word {le'ai} on its own indicates that a mistake was made while leaving all the details up to context. It is also possible to attach SAI to a le'ai construct: le'ai {dai} (or le'ai {da'oi} ko'a) indicates that someone else made a mistake; le'ai {pei} asks whether someone else made a mistake; and {sai}, {ru'e} and {cu'i} can be used to indicate the importance of the substitution. Furthermore, le'ai {nai} can be used to explicitly deny mistakes instead of acknowledging them (compare "sic").

lo'oi	experimental cmavo			   	LOhOI      	Description clause: create a sumti from the enclosed bridi, describing the referent of the created sumti as filling the bridi place filled with {ke'a}.	Notes: Full-bridi equivalent of {lo}. Terminator: {ku'au}.
lo'u	cmavo			   	LOhU      	start questionable/out-of-context quote; text should be Lojban words, but needn't be grammatical.	Terminated by {le'u}.
lu	cmavo			   	LU      	start grammatical quotation; quoted text should be grammatical on its own.
lu'a	cmavo			   	LAhE      	the members of the set/components of the mass; converts another description type to individuals.
lu'au	experimental cmavo			   	LAhE      	Bridi to text conversion	Essentially equivalent to {se} in the context of a {se} {du'u}. Inverse of {du'au}; however note that this is not single-valued, while {du'au} (provided context) is single-valued. Hence "lu'au du'au" is a useful idiom for constructing a text which has the same basic meaning as another text but is not necessarily the same text.
lu'e	cmavo			   	LAhE      	the symbol for (indirect discourse); uses the symbol/word(s) for a sumti as the desired sumti.

Probably semantically maximally and generally elliptical/generic. Typing can be restricted by (possibly metalinguistic) restriction. See also: {zai'o} (pro-sumti; empty), {gai'o} (pro-bridi; empty), {cei'i} (pro-bridi; universal), {ctaipe}. Proposed by: lai .az. .e lai .krtisfranks.
mai'o	experimental cmavo			   	LI2      	turns number into pro-sumti: the abstraction described by the utterance denoted by that number and {mai}	E.g. {mai'o pa} refers to the events or statements described earlier with {pamai}. Use {lu'e} to refer to the text. See {goi'e}, {mai}
ma'o	cmavo			   	MAhO      	convert letteral string or other mathematical expression (mex) operand to mex operator.
ma'o'e	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mathematical operator: vague/elliptical/general/generic operator	Arity is context-dependent. Properties and structure are context-dependent or vague. See also: {xo'e}, {zi'a'o}. Preferred over {ma'e'o}.
ma'oi	experimental cmavo			   	ZO      	selma'o quote; quotes a word (a cmavo) and uses it to name a selma'o.	Example: ma'oi coi is equivalent to COI. See also {ra'oi}.

mau'au	experimental cmavo			   	MAUhAU      	mekso: conversion of operator/function to operand	Must be followed by a function (meaning "f", not "f(x)" (which is a number)) or operator (such as "+"). Treats it formally and syntactically as a number so that it can be operated upon, such as by {se'au} or by a functional/operator (technical sense). Terminated by {zai'ai}; the pair essentially act as mathematical quotation marks.  Also works on connectives and {kei'i}.  Expressions may be complicated (such as with SE, NA, NAI, etc. modifying the string); perhaps one may even find a use for quoting relations (such as equality or element-hood) and/or some brivla or other cmavo.  See also: {kei'au}.
mau'e	experimental cmavo			   	MAUhE      	UI conversion start quote; converts grammatical Lojban text to cmavo of selma'o UI	Internal text/utterance must be grammatical and Lojbanic; output is some unspecified emotion relating to/specific to/associated with the referent of quoted text.

me'au	experimental cmavo			   	ME      	Convert abstract predicate sumti back to predicate	Has an inverse: {me'ei}. Essentially synonymous with {ckaji}. Differences: ckaji2 is unary whereas the me'au-predicate can have any arity; me'au is in ME.
medomoi	cmavo-compound			      		x_1 is yours among x_2 by rule/relationship x_3; x_1 is your x_2 by rule/relationship x_3.

na'au	experimental cmavo			      		converts an unevaluated mekso expression into a sumti referencing its evaluated result (if sensible/defined)	For example, would be prefixed to {ke'a} in {xe'au}-NOIhA clauses in order to reference the bracketed (unevaluated, formal) subexpression's evaluated result. In some sense, this word plays inverse of/to {me'o}, but may see less general use since expressions are typically evaluated at the end of mekso utterances.

ni'a'au	experimental cmavo			   	GAhUhAU      	mekso n-ary operator: append covariant (lower) indices to tensor	Terminated by {te'oi'oi}. Takes ordered input (A, X_1, X_2, …, X_(n-1)), where A is a tensor and X_i is an index with an understood (or elsewhere defined) ordered domain. It appends/assigns X_i to be the ith covariant index of A, which is usually designated as a subscript in the ith position to the right of A. See also: {ga'u'au}. It is probable that Einstein summation notation will be conventionally in effect.

noi'a	experimental cmavo			   	NOIhA      	PA incidental relative clause; attaches to a PA number/numeral/digit with the ke'a referring to that PA number/numeral/digit.	It attaches to the last mentioned PA, which can be only a single digit within a number rather than the entire number itself (if it has digit length greater than one in some base). Thus, beware of grouping. Confer: {poi'a}, {jau'au}. The attachment of this word to the immediately preceding word can be ovverriden by the usage of {xe'au}, which begins bracketing together an utterance/subexpression that will be considered to be the single and whole referent of the clause introduced by this word, wthe utterance of which also finishes the bracket. There is a proposal to expand the attachment of this word to any word spoken in a mekso utterance (rather than only members of selma'o PA), including members of selma'o VUhU, etc.

Terminated by {ge'u'i}. For example 'do djica tu'a loi ckafi ji noi'i lu .enai li'u ce lu na .e li'u ge'u'i loi tcati' asks 'Do you want: some coffee, some tea - where your answer can be only the former or the latter?'.

pi'ei'au	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mathematical ternary operator: not-greater-prime-counting function	Outputs the number of prime numbers that are less than or equal to the input value a according to ordering rules b in ring c; contextless default for c is the standard/typical ring of integers (Z,+,*); contextless default for b is the standard typical ordering of the ring, which is the 'normal' absolute value (signless difference/distance with/from 0) for the standard ring (Z,+,*); thus, it will usually operate as an unary operator. Usually denoted "π(n)" in the literature.
pi'ei'oi	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mathematical ternary operator: prime-generating function	The a-th prime according to ordering rules b in ring c; contextless default for c is the standard/typical ring of integers (Z,+,*); contextless default for b is the standard typical ordering of the ring, which is the 'normal' absolute value (signless difference/distance with/from 0) for the standard ring (Z,+,*); thus, it will usually operate as an unary operator. The function must be defined over the set of strictly positive integers in/for the first operand; generalizations may be possible. Ignores units and 0. It begins counting at 1 [in/for the first operand]; under contextless default conditions, the outputs increase strictly monotonically with respect to increase in the first input [a], starting with the least prime in (Z,+,*), namely 2. Usually denoted "p_i" or "Prime" in the literature.

It attaches to the last mentioned PA, which can be only a single digit within a number rather than the entire number itself (if it has digit length greater than one in some base). Thus, beware of grouping. Confer: {noi'a}, {jau'au}. The attachment of this word to the immediately preceding word can be ovverriden by the usage of {xe'au}, which begins bracketing together an utterance/subexpression that will be considered to be the single and whole referent of the clause introduced by this word, wthe utterance of which also finishes the bracket. There is a proposal to expand the attachment of this word to any word spoken in a mekso utterance (rather than only members of selma'o PA), including members of selma'o VUhU, etc.

se'u'o	experimental cmavo			   	SE      	selbri conversion question	Asks for the SE word that is intended (or at least makes the sentence true). Subscript a set of numbers that represent the order of terbri in question; the subscripted set can be a set of ordered or unordered tuples, specifying exactly which terbri may be exchanged. 'la .ralf. se'u'o xi li re ce li ci pi'u li re cebo li ci klama by boi cy' = 'Did Ralph come to B from C or to C from B?' (notably, 'Did B come to Ralph from C?' is not a possible option for answering the question). An answer is a SE string that is allowed by the selbri and by the subscripts; continuing the example, if the response is 'Ralph went to C from B', one would respond with '.i {setese}'.  Any SE word works for the general question possibility (which is the unrestricted/non-subscripted case). Essentially 'se'u'o xi sy' is equivalent to 'se xi li xo poi ke'a cmima sy' (where '{te}' is basically understood as ' se xi li jo'i pa boi ci te'u ', etc.), but the answer can be a complicated ordered sequence/string of SE words; this word complements specifically {fi'a} in the typical/same way that SE complements FA. Typically, leaving the subscripted set vague or not completely free of every possible semantic or syntactic pathology is perfectly fine; syntax and practicality will typically restrict it enough for reasonable responses to be made. See also: {re'au'e} (which alone would be used in answering that 'Ralph goes to B from C' in the previous question).

tai'e'i	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU?      	mekso unary operator: basic Schlafli symbol composer (defined only on ordered lists)	Given an ordered (typically finite) list (which is a single object) of zero or more (probably nonnegative) rational numbers, L = (X_1, X_2, ..., X_n). This word composes them in order into a Schlafli symbol S(L) with these entries exactly and without any entries that do not appear in the list so as to produce an (n-1)-dimensional regular polytope. For example: L = () implies that S(L) = S(()) is a line segment. Where L = (6), S(L) = S((6)) is a regular convex hexagon; generally, for integer X_1 > 2, S((X_1)) is a proper convex regular (X_1)-gon. S((X_1, X_2) is a proper convex regular polyhedron with polygonal faces being all of form S((X_1)) such that they are arranged with X_2 touching at each vertex of the polyhedron. Star polytopes and tessellations are supported. More general notation such as Schlafli symbols prefixed by a letter/acted upon by a function, which are affixed with/multiplied by a number or other symbols, which contain "|", etc. are not presently supported in this definition; only the most basic/classic Schlafli symbols (those composed of a single pair of curly braces containing rational numbers separated only by commas, and nothing else) are presently supported. Certain operators (such as "half", "alter", etc., as well as Cartesian product, "add"/"plus", and "join", and affixation of other numbers or symbols) have somewhat special definitions on Schlafli symbols; they are presently not supported in Lojban (but this will hopefully soon change). Not all ordered lists will produce good output. See also: {tarmrclefli}

te'au	experimental cmavo			      		iterated Cartesian product with self: A × A × ... × A, n times.	Probably belongs to selma'o VUhU but, since it is iterated JOI, there is the case for that. First argument A is a set or similar object; second argument n is a nonnegative integer; the result is the cross-product of A with itself n times. Used as a shortcut for longer, arguably more preferable, constructions so that one can more closely say "R three" and mean R^3. Emphatically not equivalent to exponentiation; it only works on sets and similar objects. See also: {te'a}, {pi'u}, {se'au}.

Thus, for integers: c=0 is succession of/on b (in which case a can be omitted or be any number), c=1 is addition, c=2 is multiplication, c=3 is exponentiation, c=4 is tetration, etc. Notice that right-grouping is in effect for all c; thus x*(y*z) is calculated, rather than (x*y)*z.

xau'e'o	experimental cmavo			   	XAUhEhO      	mekso convention default specification/definition (explicit)	This word is followed by a list of rules. The rules specify the convention by which mekso or mathematical expressions (of various kinds) are to be interpreted. Such conventions are taken to remain in effect until the end of the discourse, until repealed, or if the come to conflict with subsequent rules so marked; in the lattermost case, the subsequent rule takes precedent and the earlier rules that are in conflict with it are ignored only in the most minimal domain of application possible (for example, a rule saying "left composition of functions is denoted by "°" in all cases" could be followed by a rule saying "when a linear transformation can be represented by a matrix, left composition of two such functions is equivalent to left multiplication of their corresponding matrices and so their left composition may be represented simply by juxtaposition as is typical with/for multiplication" with result being that "°" is to be used for all left compositions of functions except when both functions being composed are linear transformations admitting matrix representations, in which case "°" could be used but adjacency alone is sufficient to denote their left composition). Collections of rules (ordered in increasing precedence) can be named and referenced by such name expressed instead of those rules at length (such as calling a (specific) rather simple set of rules defining the order of operations ".pemas."). See also: {xau'o'o}.
xau'o'o	experimental cmavo			   	XAUhOhO      	mekso convention cancellation	This word is followed by an evaluated {li} clause (yielding specifically a number n, which probably is a non-negative integer, or a set thereof (the elements of which will also be denoted by simply n, for simplicity) ). It repeals the nth most recent/last convention (counting backward) for mekso/mathematical expressions defined by {xau'e'o}. In order to repeal all such conventions (returning to the conventions specified by some grammar collection), the set should include all integers less than or equal to some sufficiently large integer (which might be {ro}); {ro} denotes the first rule defined (the last rule counting backward from the most recent)- it does not reference "all rules defined"; the most recent rule is denoted by {pa}. Any named body/ordered collection of rules (such as ".pemas.") is treated as being only one rule for the purposes of such counting.

xe'au	experimental cmavo			   	XEhAU      	mekso clausal referent bracket initializer	Works with words of selma'o NOIhA. Within a mekso expression, any sequence of words/any subexpression between this word and the (immediate/very) next unmatched member of selma'o NOIhA are consolidated into (one whole and indivisible (for the sake of the clause) entity which acts as reference of the clause introduced by the same member of NOIhA, thus overriding the default attachment of NOIhA cmavo to the word immediately preceding them in a mekso expression. A member of NOIhA is considered "unmatched" if and only if the number of intervening additional uses of this word is less than or equal to the number of members of NOIhA uttered after the usage of this word being considered. The bracketed expression is considered to be a whole and single unit that can only be referenced together and in its single entirety; the bracketed expression is considered to be formal and remains unevaluated for the purposes of the reference/clause- thus, any reference to its evaluated result must be made by modifying {ke'a}. See also: {noi'a}, {poi'a}.

In particular, {xe'u} is almost solely used in prenex in order to put a word of selma'o NU in prenex in a statement of predicate logic of third or higher order. See {bu'ai} for usage.

The default value of n is itself "xo'e", thus transforming this word into a 0-ary operator. The output is a string of digits, not a number; thus, it automatically attaches to a string of PA's if immediately preceding this word; following digits must be concatenated on; it might be necessary to convert this string into a number (especially if it is isolated and/or is being acted upon an operator that is defined as desired for numbers but not for digits or strings), but the conversion may be automatic according to the grammar (at least in some contexts). {xo'e} is considered to represent exactly one digit in the given base until it is converted into a number.

zei'ei	experimental cmavo			   	ZEIhEI      	begin quote that is converted into rafsi	Terminated by {zei'oi}. Quotes an utterance (must be grammatical) and converts it (as a whole) into a single rafsi with the meaning of "something to do with the referent of "[insert quoted text]"". Notably, does not distribute through the text, treating each word individually with left-grouping (it does not distribute {zei} before and/or after each word (as needed)); the quoted utterance is taken as a whole unit of meaning unto itself; for the former purpose, see {zei'ei'au}. This word is useful for forming quotes and mathematical expressions (formal, evaluated, or otherwise) into lujvo. This rafsi is assumed to begin the next word if the preceding text/utterance does not end with an otherwise standalone and ungrammatical rafsi (the grammar in such a situation should be discussed); in order to connect it as a rafsi within a lujvo that began before it, precede the quotation with {zei}. In order to finish a lujvo or treat the quotation as a brivla on its own, follow it with {co'e}, which is treated as if the preceding utterance (the quote) is a single word followed immediately by {zei}; in order to string multiple ZEIhEI-ZEIhOI rafsi together follow this formula: zei'ei broda zei'oi co'e zei zei'ei brode zei'oi (co'e (zei...))... . Individual rafsi outside of lujvo are typically not grammatical (except in certain quotation structures, vel sim.).
zei'ei'au	experimental cmavo			   	ZEIhEI      	begin quote that is converted into rafsi, distributing lujvo-glue between quoted words	Terminated by {zei'oi}. Begins a quote of a grammatical utterance. Between each word in the utterance, {zei} is to be interpreted and any grouping that might be applied is left-grouping. In other words, {zei} is distributed left-groupingly between each word; each word is treated on its own, individually; the quote is not treated as a whole. The final word is interpreted to have {zei} after it as well (this is a quirk of {zei'oi}), thus the quote is a string of rafsi, left-groupingly considered to be a rafsi. In order to end the lujvo formed with such a quote, follow it by {co'e}. This word compactifies large {zei}-clauses/-statements. For the perhaps generally more useful, if slightly more ambiguous, quote marker that treats the quote as a whole entity and converts it singly and wholly into a rafsi (rather than a rafsi string, as is done by this word), see: {zei'ei}. This word works as {zei'ei} does in all other regards (including as a marker for a new word (specifically a lujvo) unless preceded by {zei} or possibly by a standalone and otherwise ungrammatical rafsi). For the purpose of quoting with {ra'oi}, the result of a {zei'ei'au}-quote is treated as a single rafsi.
zei'oi	experimental cmavo			   	ZEI'OI      	end rafsi-converting quote: terminates ZEIhEI quote	Elidable terminator (rarely elidable). Ends ZEIhEI quotes. See also: {zei'ei}, {zei'ei'au}. Treats quoted utterance as a rafsi; in order to make it end a lujvo (or act on its own as a brivla), follow it with {co'e} (wherein the the quote is treated as a single word followed by {zei}).

ze'oi	experimental cmavo			   	GOhOI      	converts following word to selbri-unit: "x_1 is related to the meaning of this word in aspect x_2"	Quoting rules are similar to {zo}. Roughly, (ze'oi *coi*) ≈ (me la'e zo *coi* moi). Meant primarily to quote cmavo, to supersede use of {zei} as a way of making "tanru" out of cmavo.

zi'ai	experimental cmavo			   	UI3a      	jargon word indicator; indicates previous word is a jargon word	Jargon words are to have a single, defined, specialized meaning within one particular narrow context (e.g. a game, field of study, or industry), but may also be assigned to other meanings in other contexts. Proposed rafsi: -zam- (technically rafsi for {zai'e}; this rafsi is always placed *before* the modified morpheme(s)) Forethought variant: {zai'e}
zi'a'o	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU      	mathematical operator: the empty/null [one sense]/trivial [one sense]/blank operator	Arity is context-dependent. Induced structure is /probably/ empty/trivial [one sense] as well.

zi'oi	experimental cmavo			   	ZIhOI      	fills and deletes (in the manner as {zi'o}) all terbri of immediately previous word that are not explicitly filled with a sumti	Implicit/omitted {zo'e} will be deleted.  Deletion is only meaningful if the immediately previous word is a brivla with at least one unfilled (explicitly) terbri. In a tanru or other complicated construct, only the most recent word undergoes this terbri deletion (not every term in the construct). A selbri converted to a sumti by gadri has x1 terbri filled for the purposes of this word; likewise is the case for terbri accessed by {be} or {bei}; seltau in the main level of a sumti are filled by the gadri as well for the purposes of this word.

zoi'ai	experimental cmavo			   	ZOIhAI      	non-mekso quote/name substitution for ordered collection of prescriptions, descriptions, definitions, etc.	Delimited non-math/non-mekso quote (works like {zoi} in this respect). Treats the quote as a substitute for some formal collection of rules or mathematical description/definitions/notations; the exact meaning of the quote must be inferred as is the case with {la} or any quote; the quote is treated as a single block of text representative a single entity so described in only that case/context by the utterer; can be used to clarify the interpretation of text (convention specification; text need not be mathematical (in which case, it must be used in a meta-linguistic scope)) or as an operand of certain mathematical operators (or, more generally perhaps, bridi).  Might be useful for quoting names as descriptors for arguments of operands. For example: orderings, metrics, bases, densities, analytic properties, conventions, etc. can all be more easily described by a moniker than by a formal mathematical description. See also: {ju'au}, {se'au}, {mau'au}.
zoi'ai'e	experimental cmavo			   	ZOIhOhE      	empty string/text/word	More or less equivalent to {lu li'u}, but is useful for when that construct would not be grammatical or practical; it also be used when a single word is necessary, etc. Commonly represented by epsilon or lambda.
