bu'ai	experimental cmavo			   	NU      	abstractor: abstractor to create logically quantified selbri variable to be used in predicate logic of third or higher order.	{zo'e} and {da} are a constant and a bound variable of predicate logic of first order respectively; {co'e} and {bu'a} are a selbri constant and a bound selbri variable of predicate logic of second order respectively; in order to express predicate logic of third or higher order, it is essential to have selbri that treat selbri variables in the domain of all selbri of second order. {su'u} and {bu'ai} in selma'o NU can compose respectively a selbri constant and a bound selbri variable in the domain of all selbri of second order. In the case that {bu'ai} takes plural number of selbri variables, connect them with {ju'e} or something. Higher order is also possible by nesting {bu'ai}. Example: su'o bu'ai xe'u kei su'o bu'a ro da zo'u bu'ai da bu'a (This {xe'u} is an abstraction-variable-indicator-{selbrisle} used in order to put a word of selma'o NU in prenex.)

celguntas	cmevla			      		x_1 is Sagittarius [astronomical constellation/astrological sign].	From shooter (={celgunta}). The Babylonians identified Sagittarius as the god Pabilsaĝ, a strange centaur-like creature firing an arrow from a bow.The sumerian name may be translated as the 'Forefather' or 'Chief Ancestor' (=barda dzena?). In Greek mythology, Sagittarius is identified as a centaur: half human, half horse.
ce'o	cmavo   	-ce'o-		   	JOI      	non-logical connective: ordered sequence link; "and then", forming a sequence.
ce'oi	experimental cmavo			   	JOI      	argument list separator: acts as a comma between arguments in an argument list supplied to a function.	"ce'oi" is the word of choice to separate the arguments in bridi3. Using {ce'o} there has obvious limitations when the selbri actually calls for a sequence. Obviously, ce'oi has issues too if the selbri can accept an argument list, but this can be circumvented more readily with {ke}...{ke'e} brackets than it can with {ce'o}. Consider ".i lo ka broda cu selbri fi ko'a ce'o ko'e". Without inspecting the type requirements of {broda} and the respective types of {ko'a} and {ko'e}, one cannot determine the meaning of the {bridi}. Furthermore, if one accepts non-static typing of {sumti} places, multiple correct answers can be given for a question asking what is the bridi1. This would create ambiguity that is otherwise resolved by "ce'oi". See also {ka}, {du'u}, {me'au}.

In a tanru or other complicated construct, only the most recent word undergoes this terbri default restoration (not every term in the construct). A selbri converted to a sumti by gadri has the x1 terbri filled for the purposes of this word, but the default setting of that terbri is so restored all the same; likewise is the case for terbri accessed by {be} or {bei}; seltau in the main level of a sumti are filled by the gadri as well for the purposes of this word.

de'ai	experimental cmavo			   	DEhAI      	default value (re)specification/(re)assignment/(re)definition/over-write; set new default value (terbri-specific; permanent)	Terminates immediately previous sumti.  The immediately following (next) unfilled terbri at that level of nesting is affected by this word; if no such terbri exists at that level of nesting, this word's affects apply to the next unfilled terbri in the immediately higher level of nesting (unnested once); if no unfilled terbri exist at any/all levels of nesting and following the immediately previous sumti (even if unfilled terbri exist prior to that sumti), this word has no meaningful affect and can be ignored.  This word must be followed by a sumti; for the purpose of this explanation, this sumti will be xy (as in "de'ai xy").  The affected terbri is defined to default to the value xy (the sumti as a whole, including gadri, tanru, relative clauses, etc.); in other words, when not explicitly filled or when filled be {di'au}, the sumti value filling the affected terbri is that of xy.  This affect remains in effect until the end of the text/conversation or until/unless the default setting of this terbri explicitly redefined (overriding by {di'ei} is temporary/only applies to that usage). If xy is {zo'e}, the default value is completely general and elliptical; thus, permanently overriding a default setting on a specific terbri may be done by "de'ai zo'e". The scope of this word fully encompasses and ends with the following sumti (xy); thus, the second sumti, same-/higher-level terminator, a FA cmavo, etc. following this word ends the new default specification in addition to its other functions.  Additionally, this word does not actually fill the affected terbri with any particular sumti/value; it merely defines its default value hereinafter. CAUTION: Thus, the second same-level sumti uttered actually fills the affected terbri; in order to access the newly-defined default value of the terbri immediately after definition, follow "xy" (with terminator) immediately with implicit (or possibly explicit) "{zo'e}" (possibly necessitating terminators), "{di'au}", or "xy" itself. Moreover, therefore, the default value defined by this word does not immediately/necessarily affect the truth value of the statement in which it appears (it only does so if the second following sumti is not {di'au}, implicit (or possibly) explicit {zo'e}, or xy itself); however, in all future uses of the brivla to which the terbri belongs, unless explicitly filled with a sumti of a different value, the truth value of those statements will be affected.  Also, {su} does not erase this new definition of default. If the affected terbri is naturally defined to have a default or if it has no naturally defined default value, this word semi-permanently over-writes them.

It does not necessarily reference the value defined "officially". ({zo'e}, implicit or explicit, may do so as well, but the use of this word implies some degree of a more deliberate choice to follow the default specification.) When a default of the terbri is not specified by the previous discourse (nor by the discourse-exterior "official" definition of the terbri if not specification modifications have been made previously), this word is equivalent to completely general and elliptical {zo'e}. See also: {di'oi}, {di'ei}.

Thus, there is no simple way to reference the "general" elliptical/unspecified value for these sumti, other than by using this word.  {zo'e} typically is interpreted as meaning any value of some general and unspecified set of potential sumti referents, modulated by context and the need to make the statement true; in the case of an explicit default setting of a terbri by the definition of a word, {di'ei} takes on this general and unspecified meaning, effectively ignoring the default (although it can take on the value of that default (doing so, simply, is just not necessary)); when no default is specified for the terbri in the definition, this word has the same meaning as {zo'e}.

fertis	cmevla			      		x_1 is Virgo [constellation/astrological sign].	From {ferti}. The Greeks and Romans associated Virgo with their goddess of wheat, Demeter-Ceres who is the mother of Proserpina-Persephone. For this reason the constellation became associated with fertility (in both Babylonia, Greece and Rome). Alternatively, she was sometimes identified as the virgin goddess Iustitia or Astraea, holding the scales of justice in her hand as the constellation Libra. Since ferti in lojban covers both potential and actual/realized fertility, the original meaning of the constellation have been chosen, but you could probably still interpret the name in both senses (as a deity of fecundity or as a fertile virgin).

jau'au	experimental cmavo			   	VUhU3      	unary mathematical operator: length/components of formal string in some base/basis; number of digits/components/entries	For a numerical string, the number of digits are counted. For a tuple/vector/array/matrix/tensor, the number of entries/conponents is counted. Not literally the number of symbols used, but the number of meaningful "spots" occupied; for example "(1,0)" uses five characters, but its length is just 2 (for "1" and then "0"); this is due to the fact that formal representation may vary but the amount of information conveyed must remain constant. Note that digit strings are essentially considered to be vectors in the basis of powers of the base.
jaurbarflegaus	cmevla			      		x_1 is Aquarius [astronomical constellation/astrological sign].	From {djacu}, {barfle}, {gasnu}. Aquarius is identified as "The Great One" in the Babylonian star catalogues and represents the god Ea himself, who is commonly depicted holding an overflowing vase. In the Greek tradition, the constellation became represented as simply a single vase from which a stream poured down.
ja'urjuknis	cmevla			      		x_1 is Scorpius [astronomical constellation]/Scorpio [astrological sign].	The Babylonians called this constellation the 'Scorpion'. In Greek Mythology there are plenty of  myths associated with Scorpio.

Potentially useful for academic or technical honesty. "Error" may be rendered as "incompleteness of truth" or "approximation" in this context.

When both parts are omitted, the word {le'ai} on its own indicates that a mistake was made while leaving all the details up to context. It is also possible to attach SAI to a le'ai construct: le'ai {dai} (or le'ai {da'oi} ko'a) indicates that someone else made a mistake; le'ai {pei} asks whether someone else made a mistake; and {sai}, {ru'e} and {cu'i} can be used to indicate the importance of the substitution. Furthermore, le'ai {nai} can be used to explicitly deny mistakes instead of acknowledging them (compare "sic").

This word begins a parenthetical which can contain UI cmavo and applies these cmavo as a string of UI to the immediately previous UI cmavo metalinguistically (as if the external UI are any other type of word which can be acted upon by UI). An omitted UI (external or internal) in this case is equivalent to {ge'e}. Since the produced parenthetical functions as UI, nested or subsequent such parentheticals operate on it as it operates on external UI cmavo. See also: {toi'o}.

xau'e'o	experimental cmavo			   	XAUhEhO      	mekso convention default specification/definition (explicit)	This word is followed by a list of rules. The rules specify the convention by which mekso or mathematical expressions (of various kinds) are to be interpreted. Such conventions are taken to remain in effect until the end of the discourse, until repealed, or if the come to conflict with subsequent rules so marked; in the lattermost case, the subsequent rule takes precedent and the earlier rules that are in conflict with it are ignored only in the most minimal domain of application possible (for example, a rule saying "left composition of functions is denoted by "°" in all cases" could be followed by a rule saying "when a linear transformation can be represented by a matrix, left composition of two such functions is equivalent to left multiplication of their corresponding matrices and so their left composition may be represented simply by juxtaposition as is typical with/for multiplication" with result being that "°" is to be used for all left compositions of functions except when both functions being composed are linear transformations admitting matrix representations, in which case "°" could be used but adjacency alone is sufficient to denote their left composition). Collections of rules (ordered in increasing precedence) can be named and referenced by such name expressed instead of those rules at length (such as calling a (specific) rather simple set of rules defining the order of operations ".pemas."). See also: {xau'o'o}.
xau'o'o	experimental cmavo			   	XAUhOhO      	mekso convention cancellation	This word is followed by an evaluated {li} clause (yielding specifically a number n, which probably is a non-negative integer, or a set thereof (the elements of which will also be denoted by simply n, for simplicity) ). It repeals the nth most recent/last convention (counting backward) for mekso/mathematical expressions defined by {xau'e'o}. In order to repeal all such conventions (returning to the conventions specified by some grammar collection), the set should include all integers less than or equal to some sufficiently large integer (which might be {ro}); {ro} denotes the first rule defined (the last rule counting backward from the most recent)- it does not reference "all rules defined"; the most recent rule is denoted by {pa}. Any named body/ordered collection of rules (such as ".pemas.") is treated as being only one rule for the purposes of such counting.
