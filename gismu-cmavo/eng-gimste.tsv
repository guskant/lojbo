Body language, posturing, and stature are usually considered to be nonlocalized (body-general), although they need not be (and technically are not in general). Must be externally visible and/or internally sensed. Any non-body-part utensil/item (including clothing) must function as an extension of the body in the gesture. Need not be conscious or performed by a person (note that agent/performer is not mentioned in this definition); can, but need not, be accompanied by vocalizations (not necessarily linguistic), but the gesture itself is not primarily noise-producing. Might include sign language words or cheremes, although a more explicit word for linguistically organized and “full” cheremes is preferred (and especially for the sign language as a whole). x1 is possibly best typed by {nu} and/or {si'o}. x4 might be best expressed as an event; for example, it could be "the event of the right hand touching the chest near the heart, with fist clenched" for a salute, whereas/wherein x3 would be merely the fist/hand (and the chest near the heart). Use {cocygau} for: x1 (agent) gestures; x1 agentively/actively makes gesture x2, communicating x3, performed with body part(s) x4 in motion x5. Proposed short rafsi: -coc-.

digno	experimental gismu			      	x_1 is aligned diagonally along/between nonadjacent vertices x_2 as in polytope x_3; x_1 is a diagonal line segment/linear manifold of lower dimension as viewed in frame of reference x_3; x_1 is crooked (one sense), skew (one sense, see notes), off-kilter (one sense), away from center/off-center, non-orthogonal/not perpendicular nor parallel, at an angle, perhaps non-vertical and non-horizontal, diagonal to x_2 in figure/coordinate system x_3.	Not for use in: entries of tensors/matrices (confer: {daigno}), certain geometric meanings (such as with Cartesian products), etc.  Only for purely 'visual' geometric objects/figures/frames. The polytope in question need not actually be 'drawn'; an oriented frame of reference naturally 'projects' a polytopic sense onto all objects. x1 can be any linear manifold of lower dimension than the space in which it is embedded (defined by x3). The skewness is not relative to another linear manifold in some higher-dimensional space (the usual definition of "skew" in geometry) - it is simply a skewness (in a layperson sense) relative to points in a figure or axis in a coordinate system. Proposed by Gleki.

dutso	experimental gismu			      	x_1 is clockwise/right-turn-direction of[/to] x_2 along/following track x_3 [path] in frame of reference x_4 (where the axis is within the region defined by the track as the boundary, as viewed from and defined by view(er) x_4; see notes); x_1 is locally to the right of x_2, according to x_4, constrained along x_3; x_1 is along a right turn from x_2 along path x_3, as viewed in frame x_4.	Angular/curling direction: clockwise. he orientation of the path determines x4 but does not factor into consideration for x3. Further glosses: clockwise, locally rightward, right-turning (with no bulk translation) in a way that would be characterized as "negative" by the right-hand rule (aligned with and in the direction of a basis vector, at least for a given component). x1 is left-handedly/clockwise(ly) oriented relative to x2 on/along x3 in frame of reference x4.  x1 is left-handed (one sense) from x2 [more accurately: moving from x2 to x1 requires a(n imaginary) motion that is left-handed about/along x3 as seen in frame/orientation/perspective x4]. x1 is to the path-following right of x2 (where the path is connected; as such, x1 is also be to the path-following left of x2, although there is an implication that the former is the smaller (or equal-length) path). See also: {zucna}, {du'ei} (left-handed vectorial cross product), {du'oi} (modal). Proposed short rafsi: -tso-.

jensi	experimental gismu			      	x_1 is a (set/pair) of scissors/shears/clippers/(hedge) trimmers/tongs [tool] with parts/blades x_2 (scissor) and used for purpose x_3	x1 is any whole tool composed of parts (blades, x2) which slide relative to one another, usually (but not necessarily) around a common pivot, so that little distance is between the blades.  The blades need not close all the way nor do they need to be sharp or used for cutting(they could be used for grasping). Tongs typically are grasping-scissors, but tweezers are not. The emphasis is on how the blades move relative to one another and how they are connected to handles; the design is usually simple with only a few separate funtional parts. At least part of the blades should be to the side of the respective part of the other blade (so that these regions can move/slide relative to one another), even if the blades as a whole meet and cannot slide passed one another completely (such as with tongs). x1 is the whole object/tool, x2 are the parts which move relative to one another; in English, x1 could be called the "(pair of) scissors" whereas x2 could be called "the scissor (blade)".

Additionally, actually having this word be part of the Lojban dictionary will allow for its free use within Lojban text and it can be coupled with version specifiers for text (per various proposals). This word might be generalizable to any gadri-specific (proposed) grammar systems for Lojban, rather than Xorlo (as currently understood, or future versions thereof) specifically.  See also: {cukre}.

The word "metaphysics" could be translated with/using this word. All meta things (in the sense of {cmeta}) are necessarily xulta, but the converse is not true; may also include all things that are {sucta}. This word is different from {sucta} in that no concept or properties need to be generalized/simplified/idealized/abstracted from x2 in order to produce x1 (by some rules); x1 is just an object/concept/system/etc. that exists beyond/external to x2 (in some "higher plane", so to speak).

zgadi	experimental gismu			      	x_1 (abstraction) should/(of right) ought to be true/happening under conditions/in the case of x_2 being true/happening, as believed by/by standard/under consideration of x_3. If the world were proper/correct/just/ruled perfectly and strictly according to x_3 and if x_2 were true, then x_1 would be true as well.	If the world were proper/correct/just according to x_3 and if x_2 were true, then x_1 would be true as well. Moral judgment goes in x3. x3 can also be assumed by expectation under hypothesized laws of physics, by the true situation of the world, etc. Synonymous with {cadga}.

zmiku	gismu   	-zmi-		      	x_1 is automatic in function x_2 under conditions x_3.	See also {macnu}.
zucna	experimental gismu			      	x_1 is counterclockwise/left-turn-direction of[/to] x_2 along/following track x_3 [path] in frame of reference x_4 (where the axis is within the region defined by the track as the boundary, as viewed from and defined by view(er) x_4; see notes); x_1 is locally to the left of x_2, according to x_4, constrained along x_3; x_1 is along a left turn from x_2 along path x_3, as viewed in frame x_4.	Angular/curling direction: counterclockwise. The orientation of the path determines x4 but does not factor into consideration for x3. Further glosses: counterclockwise, locally leftward, left-turning (with no bulk translation) in a way that would be characterized as "positive" by the right-hand rule (aligned with and in the direction of a basis vector, at least for a given component). x1 is right-handedly/counterclockwise(ly) oriented relative to x2 on/along x3 in frame of reference x4  x1 is right-handed (one sense) from x2 [more accurately: moving from x2 to x1 requires a(n imaginary) motion that is right-handed along x3 as seen in frame/orientation/perspective x4]. x1 is to the path-following left of x2 (where the path is connected; as such, x1 is also be to the path-following right of x2, although there is an implication that the former is the smaller (or equal-length) path). See also: {dutso}, {za'ei} (vectorial cross product), {zu'au} (modal). Proposed short rafsi: -zuc-, -zu'a-. (If “zn” ever becomes a permissible initial consonant pair, krtisfranks proposes that “-zna-” become a rafsi of this word- it makes {zucna} and {dutso} more parallel in lujvo formation, and he is of the opinion that this word is useful and basic enough to warrant such a prized rafsi assignment; after this addition, the current two rafsi proposals can be done away with, reassigned, maintained, vel sim. as desired by the community at the time. In particular, he recognizes that “-zu’a-” might be confusing as a rafsi for this word while being a modal cmavo for {zunle}; but he does believe that this word deserves a vowel-final short rafsi.)
