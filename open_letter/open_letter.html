	<ul>First, sorry for my poor English. I don't correct it for the identity of the letter sent.</ul>
	<ul>Secondly, if you don't understand the situation, please watch <a href="https://vimeo.com/190637628" target="_blank">the documentary film <i>lo vliraitru (The dictator)</i></a>. It is spoken in Lojban but subtitled in English (and some other languages in future). <a href="http://guskant.github.io/lojbo/vliraitru/evidence.html" target="_blank">All the pieces of evidence for the documentary are collected here.</a></ul>
	<ul>Thirdly, most new learners of Lojban don't understand the reason why I continue "attacking" Gleki, and some of them regard my actions as "xajmi mi loka cizra (funny in strangeness)" or even "dislike". I understand that "the situation appears bad to newcomers to the language", but I have no responsibility for the bad situation. I am a (maybe the only) victim of Gleki's official-pretending support to attackers on me. I don't mind those attacks that came from difference of values, but I will never forgive Gleki's abuse of power because it brings unfairness between various dialects of Lojban. I therefore continue resistance against his dictatorship. Please don't blame me for the situation.

<h1>Open letter to LLG.</h1>
<h2>Demand for depriving Gleki of his administratorship and of official-pretending accounts.</h2>
<h3>Introduction.</h3>
<div class="letter">
Dear LLG members, 
</div>
<div class="letter">
This is an open letter of my simple demand. The identical contents are published at <a href="http://guskant.github.io/lojbo/open_letter/" target="_blank">http://guskant.github.io/lojbo/open_letter/</a> . The URL is posted also to the lojban mailing list.
</div>
<div class="letter">
Gleki is an administrator of the official website <a name="website1" href="#website">[1]</a>. Gleki put useful tools on the official website, and also created a Lojban course for beginners. In the course, Gleki taught some unofficial features with notice of "unofficial". That is not a crime. 
</div>
<div class="letter">
Gleki let the learners use the tools that he put on the official website. That is not a crime. 
</div>
<div class="letter">
Gleki did not make clear the responsible person of the tools. <span class="emph">That is a crime. </span>
</div>
<div class="letter">
Gleki called the contents of his course as "modern dialects of Lojban" <a name="labangu1" href="#labangu">[2]</a>, while Gleki called my parser Zantufa as "different from Lojban" <a name="guskanbau1" href="#guskanbau">[3]</a>. That made my life as a Lojbanic artist difficult but is not a crime. 
</div>
<div class="letter">
Gleki advertised his course using official-pretending accounts of Twitter <a name="twitter1" href="#twitter">[4]</a> or email <a name="email1" href="#email">[5]</a>. <span class="emph">That activity combined with his terms of abuse on my parser Zantufa <a name="guskanbau2" href="#guskanbau">[3]</a> removed my life as a Lojbanic artist and is a crime.</span>
</div>
<div class="letter">
I don't demand to stop any critics on my works including Zantufa. Actually, Durka42 published much more terms of abuse on my parser Zantufa than Gleki did, and Tsani also joined Durka42. Although I qualified them "despicable" <a name="zantufa_notes1" href="#zantufa_notes">[6]</a>, I don't demand them to stop their "critics" on my works. Anyone has freedom to be despicable to me.
</div>
<div class="letter">
However, I herewith make a complaint against Gleki for abusing his administratorship on the official website and for his official-pretending Twitter account <a name="twitter2" href="#twitter">[4]</a> and e-mail account <a name="email2" href="#email">[5]</a>. I demand depriving Gleki of his administratorship on the official website and of official-pretending accounts <a name="twitter3" href="#twitter">[4]</a> <a name="email3" href="#email">[5]</a>. The tools put on the official website by Gleki should be moved to Gleki's own website other than lojban.org, or kept on the official website and maintained by a new administrator other than Gleki with clear mentioning about the responsible person of the tools.
</div>
<h3>Details of Gleki's crimes.</h3>
<div class="letter">
Gleki advertised his course and his tools using official-pretending accounts. That activity makes people believe that Gleki's contents were admitted by the official body as "modern dialects of Lojban". That activity combined with his terms of abuse on my parser Zantufa produces <span class="emph">totalitarism</span> of letting people believe that some unofficial suggestions are modern dialects of Lojban and my parser Zantufa is non-Lojban. <span class="emph">That totalitarism removes my life as a Lojbanic artist because all my recent and future Lojbanic artworks are parsed by Zantufa.</span> I regard that activity of Gleki as an appearance of <span class="emph">Gleki's dictatorship on Lojban community</span>.
</div>
<div class="letter">
Gleki put tools that may help Lojban speakers on the official website without any explicit notice about the responsible person of the tools themselves. For example, the ilmentufa parsers on the official website <a name="mw_ilmentufa1" href="#mw_ilmentufa">[7]</a> were commonly announced on mediawiki pages of the official website <a name="website2" href="#website">[1]</a>, as well as in other communities, that they are parsers for the official grammar and for an experimental grammar respectively. Those parsers contain no information about the responsible person for the contents themselves. Some people may believe that the contents were identical to those of one of ilmen's or Lojban coder's group's github repositories <a name="ilmen_ilmentufa1" href="#ilmen_ilmentufa">[8]</a> <a name="lojban_ilmentufa1" href="#lojban_ilmentufa">[9]</a>.
</div>
<div class="letter">
The reality <a name="gleki_destroy1" href="#gleki_destroy">[10]</a> is however that the contents on the official website <a name="website3" href="#website">[1]</a> are identical neither to ilmen's, nor to lojban coder's group's, but to gleki's personal folder on the vrici server of lojban.org <a name="vrici_ilmentufa1" href="#vrici_ilmentufa">[11]</a> and also to gleki's github repository <a name="gleki_ilmentufa1" href="#gleki_ilmentufa">[12]</a>.
</div>
<div class="letter">
The fact that Gleki controls the contents on the official website <a name="website4" href="#website">[1]</a> is problematic because Gleki does not have ability to distinguish official from personal. Gleki don't understand all his activities are not admitted by the official body, regardless of whether the activities are good or not for Lojban community. The evidences for that are shown below.
</div>

<h4>Evidence 1.</h4>
<div class="letter">
Gleki removed the expression of "culturally neutral", the official words of CLL Chapter 1 Section 1, from the top page of the official website <a name="website5" href="#website">[1]</a> without any notice to the official body. He explained the reason: "I periodically get some negative feedback or questions and when no one seem to answer them I remove corresponding strings." <a name="llg_meeting1" href="#llg_meeting">[13]</a> That response is one of the evidence that Gleki does not have ability to distinguish official from personal: Gleki modified the contents of the official website freely as if it were his own website. Gleki removed even the official words from the top page of the official website for the reason of "some negative feedback" that are unknown to the official body. 
</div>

<h4>Evidence 2.</h4>
<div class="letter">
Gleki is creating many pages on his original research without mentioning "unofficial contents" or "Gleki's personal page" <a name="original_research1" href="#original_research">[14]</a>. There is no notice about the responsibility of the contents. The history of modifications to the pages is visible only to logged-in accounts, and general visitors cannot identify whether the contents are supported by the official body or not <a name="history1" href="#history">[15]</a>. Although it is true that LLG-related pages are tagged with "An official page of LLG", that does not imply that pages with no tag are officially unsupported. When even the top page is not tagged with "official", who can imagine that the official website is almost filled with Gleki's original research, and only a few pages tagged with "official" are really official? Whether Gleki's original research is good or not is not my subject. Gleki created many contents of his original research on the official website without mentioning the responsibility of the contents, and that is one of the evidence that Gleki does not have ability to distinguish official from personal. My demand is simple: tag them with "Gleki's original research/opinion/...", or move them all to Gleki's own website.
</div>

<h4>Evidence 3.</h4>
<div class="letter">
When I made a remark on Gleki's conceilment of his previous version of his course, he responded: "Because it's not egocentric and on the contrary altruistic. What can even be egocentric in an activity for which personally I gain nothing." <a name="altruistic1" href="#altruistic">[16]</a>
</div>
<div class="letter">
Actually, Gleki had been revising in keeping the history of pages <a name="labangu_history1" href="#labangu_history">[17]</a> <a name="labangu2" href="#labangu">[2]</a>, but he removed the whole history after my posts to mailing lists of blaming for his various activities of abusing his administratorship and using official-pretending accounts. He did not take my remarks as evidences of his crimes, but he treated the remarks as if they were feedback to his contents. That is one of the evidence that Gleki does not have ability to distinguish official from personal: Gleki completely disregarded my remarks about his confusion of official with personal, and treated them as if feedback to his personal contents. 
</div>

<h4>Evidence 4.</h4>
<div class="letter">
Gleki said "I'm intolerant to everything beyond CLL. Even my unofficial parsers are merely a playtoy, a tool to study Lojban, not to break it. Changing Lojban is breaking its community which already happened once in 2004." <a name="intolerant1" href="#intolerant">[18]</a>
</div>
<div class="letter">
That comment of Gleki contradicts what he wrote on another page. Gleki actually "carefully selects new rules and lexicon being introduced into the language compared to Standard Lojban" <a name="labangu3" href="#labangu">[2]</a>, clearly mentioning that the language he taught includes "conflicts with CLL Lojban that break past usage" <a name="labangu4" href="#labangu">[2]</a>. Gleki by himself selected some features beyond CLL, that conflicts CLL, and taught them as "modern dialects of Lojban" <a name="labangu5" href="#labangu">[2]</a>, while publicly excluding my parsers Zantufa from Lojban works <a name="guskanbau3" href="#guskanbau">[3]</a>. Nevertheless, Gleki advertised his contents using official-pretending accounts. That is one of the evidence that Gleki does not have ability to distinguish official from personal. 
</div>

<h4>Evidence 5.</h4>
<div class="letter">
Gleki controls official-pretending accounts on twitter <a name="twitter4" href="#twitter">[4]</a>. Besides retweets of other Lojbanists, some of his tweets are news or response to feedback to the official website, and most of his tweets are his personal opinions <a name="sheet1" href="#sheet">[19]</a>. That is one of the evidence that Gleki does not have ability to distinguish official from personal. 
</div>

<h4>Evidence 6.</h4>
<div class="letter">
Gleki announced <a name="cll20announce1" href="#cll20announce">[20]</a> that he prepared a repository on github for editing the next version of CLL <a name="cll201" href="#cll20">[21]</a>. Gleki modified some critical points on the draft for the next version of CLL without consulting BPFK <a name="observative1" href="#observative">[22]</a> <a name="voi1" href="#voi">[23]</a>. Gleki explained about one of the modifications: "Since there is no official policy on how to assess such push requests another person merged them into the CLL 2.0 branch. After that I had no idea how the process should go on so I as for {voi} I simply temporarily commented it out, not removing that content. Maybe I should have made another push request for it. But push request can again be merged by someone else." <a name="voi_reason1" href="#voi_reason">[24]</a> That response is an evidence that Gleki freely performed his personal experiment on a common repository of lojban coder's group, not on his personal repository. Gleki could perform his personal experiment on his own repository without sending pull request to the common repository, but he did not choose that way. That is one of the evidence that Gleki does not have ability to distinguish official from personal. 
</div>

<h3>Conclusion.</h3>
<div class="letter">
I don't demand to stop Gleki's activities on tools, learning materials, communications etc. I demand only that Gleki should do them on his own website, using his own account. Don't let Gleki pretend to be official. Gleki did not sincerely answer to my remarks, and changed the subjects as if those were feedback to his personal contents. Gleki does not have ability to recognize hiw own crimes. In order to stop his dictatorship, there is no way other than depriving Gleki of his administratorship on the official website and of official-pretending accounts <a name="twitter5" href="#twitter">[4]</a> <a name="email4" href="#email">[5]</a>.
