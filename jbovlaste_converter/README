multi.sh contains linux shell scripts that will convert xml dumps from la jbovlaste into StarDict dictionary files and gimste/ma'oste html/tsv files. It requires the files in the directory tree under jbovlaste_converter, as well as stardict-tools-3.0.1 with a patch, and dictzip package (which is in dictd package for gentoo) for creating .dz files.

See 
https://github.com/guskant/lojbo/tree/master/stardict-tools-patch
for the patch.

Optionally, it can create a mobi formatted dictionary for Kindle Paperwhite by using kindlegen and uncommenting the last seven lines of multi.sh. Modify the commands in it if you need a dictionary other than French, Japanese and English languages.
See

for kindlegen.
