multi.sh is a linux bash file that will convert xml dumps from la jbovlaste into StarDict dictionary files. It requires the files in the directory tree under jbovlaste_converter, as well as stardict-tools-3.0.1 with a patch.
See 
https://github.com/guskant/lojbo/tree/master/stardict-tools-patch
for the patch.

Optionally, it can create a mobi formatted dictionary for Kindle Paperwhite by using kindlegen and uncommenting the last four lines of multi.sh. Modify the commands in it if you need a dictionary other than French, Japanese and English languages.
See 
http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211
for kindlegen.



Usage.
Download xml dumps from jbovlaste:
http://jbovlaste.lojban.org/export/xml.html
Requirement:
_Login to the website_ and _right-click and save as_ *.xml into the folder 
jbovlaste_converter/xml
Viewing on a browser and/or logged-out of the website may not bring you a required format. English, Lojban and Japanese files must be named as follows:
eng.xml
jbo.xml
jpn.xml

eng.xml and jbo.xml are necessary for all languages. If you don't need a Japanese dictionary, input "#" at the beginning of the line number 11 of multi.sh.

The following command will produce Stardict dictionary files.
$ cd [...path to...]jbovlaste_converter
$ ./multi.sh
